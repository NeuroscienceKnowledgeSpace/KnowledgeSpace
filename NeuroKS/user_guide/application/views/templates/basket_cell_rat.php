                                    The cortical basket cell is a class of <span class="tooltip-el" data-toggle="tooltip" data placement="top" title="General class of neurons that send and receive connections from other neurons">interneurons</span> usually found in layers II-V. They are characterized by specific axonal terminations, which are in the form of pericellular "baskets" around the cell bodies of the target cells. Basket cells are distinct from other types of interneurons in that they have the highest tendency to target somata.
                                   Cortical basket cells are further subdivided morphologically 
                                   and electrophysiologically.

                                    Within the upper part of the Ju, there is a third neuronal type, the basket cell (BC), which accounts for about 8% of the neurons observed in the nucleus. The BCs correspond to the second type of short-axon neurons observed in the Ju. The soma of these neurons is ovoid, measuring from 18 to 22 micrometers in the longest axis. The perikaryon gives rise to a dorsal dendrite and one or two lateral dendrites, which in both cases ramify quickly into long secondary shafts and rarely provide short tertiary branches. Four additional features characterize the dendrites of BC: They follow a straight trajectory; they display varicosities; they bear a few dendritic spines; and at least one set of dendrites is meshed into the axonal bundles surrounding the Ju. In every cell, the axon descends from the lower pole of the soma, and shortly afterward gives rise to a number of recurrent fibers adopting the form of typical axonal arcades that return to the dendritic field proper (Fig. 4A,B). These recurrent axonal branches are in apposition to the adjacent somata and/or to proximal dendrites of bipolar and pyramidal neurons. In three of the sampled neurons, the axon proceeds farther ventrally, issuing additional horizontal collaterals along its way. Both the descending axon and the horizontal collaterals appear to terminate as en passage and terminal boutons on the shafts and spines of bipolar and triangular neurons.

                                    The core of the Ov exhibits a neuron type that strongly resembles the basket cells described by Ramon y Cajal (1904) in the mammalian neocortex and by Larriva-Sahd (2004) in the adult rat Ju of the BST. BCs have a small (15–20 micrometers), triangular or pear-shaped soma that gives rise to two or four primary divergent dendrites that divide sequentially into secondary and terminal (i.e., tertiary) branches. Three characteristics are consistently observed in BC dendrites: 1) shafts hold distinct varicosities, 2) shafts are virtually devoid of spines, and 3) the dendritic field they form is relatively small (150–180 micrometers). The axon arises from the soma, and it is usually directed ventrally. Typically, the axon gives rise to transverse collaterals, which curve in the form of arcades that return toward the neuron’s own dendritic tree (see Jones and Hendry, 1984). Occasional straight collaterals, usually from the main axon, descend farther ventrally. An additional feature of certain BCs is that their recurrent collaterals appear to contact the dendritic processes of the cell, resembling that documented by Fairen et al. (1982) for the homologous neurons in the isocortex, the so-called autapses.

                                    Compared with the granule cell, the basket cell is quite complicated. It receives synapses from parallel fibers and to a limited extent from climbing fibers, but it devotes its entire axonal output to the Purkinje cells with the possible exception of a few contacts on other basket cells and Golgi cells. A large number of widely dispersed parallel fibers converge on its dendrites, but its axon sends divergent impulses to only a small number of Purkinje cells. The basket cell has a roughly pyramidal or ovoid shape, and it lies in the lower third of the molecular layer with its long axis parallel to the Purkinje cell layer in the sagittal plane. In Nissl preparations little more can be seen of it than its triangular or oval cell body, about 10 micrometers long....Ramon y Cajal (1888a and b) was the first to discover the characteristic terminal plexus elaborated around the Purkinje cell body by the axons of these cells. He named this formation the pericellular nest (nid pericellulaire). His finding was quickly confirmed by Kolliker (1890), who referred to the same structure as a "fiber basket" (Faserkorb), and to the cells that gave rise to it as "basket cells" (Korbzellen).
