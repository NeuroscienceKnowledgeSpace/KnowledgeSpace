In the [...] penetrations made within this region, responses were obtained from only contralateral receptive fields by gentle mechanical stimulation of peripheral body surfaces.

									The physiological boundaries of SmI coincided with a cytoarchitectural area which exhibited a prominent granular IVth layer. Distinct multicellular aggregates were found within layer IV of the facial sinus hair area. The location of these aggregates, their number (which was similar to the number of facial sinus hairs), and their somatotopic arrangement suggested the hypothesis that each aggregate is a functional unit which receives somatic sensory information from a single, specific sinus hair. In most regions of SmI there is a very prominent layer IV composed of small, densely packed, darkly stained granular cells. The distinctiveness of layer IV is further enhanced by the paleness of layer Va just below it. In most areas of SmI layer Vb contains pyramidal cells of medium size. The medial part of SmI,however, is distinguished by many more relatively large cells in layer Vb.

									The region considered as the SI cortex is not a cytoarchitecturally homogeneous structure but consists instead of a patchwork array of areas containing dense aggregations of layer IV granule cells, surrounded by granule-cell-sparse regions. As was shown by Welker (1971,1976), and in our own mapping studies, this discontinuous pattern of granular, or koniocortical, zones contains within itself a map of the rat's cutaneous periphery. There are clear subtypes within this cytoarchitectural subregion, notably including the granular aggregate type of cytoarchitecture characteristic of the paw, limb, and mystacial vibrissae areas, and the barrel-field type (originally described by Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970) seen in the nose and perioral regions. In the mouse, but not the rat, such barrels also cover the whole whisker representation (Welker and Woolsey, 1974).
