##Description
KnowledgeSpace (KS) is the interface between neuroscience knowledge and data from around the world. KnowledgeSpace supplies a dynamic semantic framework that comes from existing ontologies (concepts to full ontologies), as well as data and data models. The data in KnowledgeSpace comes from either general or community-specific repositories. Repositories can drag vocabularies from KnowledgeSpace via SciCrunch, as well as push vocabularies back to KnowledgeSpace. Features of KnowledgeSpace that simplify integration and facilitate querying include:
1. Controlled vocabularies and RRIDs
2. Repository APIs
3. Common data models, open formats, and data elements
The interface which is a work in progress currently looks like an encyclopedia; but in time, we plan for the representation to look like a brain (rodent, human, etcâ€¦). KnowledgeSpace is a loose confederation of people working together to maintain the framework, data, and data models, and we welcome participation and contributions from members of the global research community (neuroscientists, ontologists, and developers). It has support from a number of projects or organizations such as the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility, the Blue Brain Project, the Human Brain Project, the Neuroscience Information Framework, and others. KnowledgeSpace contains both source and remote content. You are being granted a limited license to copy anything from KnowledgeSpace as well as link to the content of KnowledgeSpace from your tools, resources, or websites. All data indexed and referenced by KnowledgeSpace, unless otherwise stated, are licensed by the respective owners of such data.

##Requirements
1. PHP version: PHP 5.4.40+
2. Web server: Apache web server

##Technical details
The KS utilizes the CodeIgniter-3.0.3 to the maintain the Model View Controller(MVC) structure. For example, the URL such as
/NeuroKS/index.php/pages/view/UBERON:0001950 will first access the controllers/Pages.php and then the view function in the class. The Pages class extends CI_Controller, which is the controller in the MVC structure. 

The PHP file at /controllers/ServiceUtil.php contains all utility functions for accessing the data through the REST API.


##Installation
1. Check out the latest source code
2. Copy or move KnowledgeSpace/* to your $apache_document_root (For example, /var/www/html)

##Configuration
1. Edit $apache_document_root/NeuroKS/application/config/config.json.
  1. enable_caching - Enable caching webpages for the faster runtime.
  2. cache_folder - The folder for storing the cached data.
  3. sources - Append additional source items to the "sources" array for the dataspace.
2. Change the background image: Edit parallax-slider.css
