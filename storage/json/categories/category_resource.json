Our large database is structured, providing consistent information for all species to foster comparisons. An advanced search tool allows a user to call up species accounts fitting any combination of descriptors. Students can explore for patterns and relationships, learn how to frame and answer scientific questions and, with the help of a good teacher, experience the excitement and satisfaction of doing science. Our long-term goal is to create a database rich enough that students can discover for themselves basic concepts in ecology and conservation biology. :A Virtual Museum: ADW provides a way to make the contents of research museums available globally for teaching and research. So far, our efforts have been directed mainly at mammals. Photographs of scientific specimens are available for representative species from most mammal families. We''ve also included several hundred Quick Time Virtual Reality Movies of skulls. These allow the user to rotate the specimen, providing an excellent impression of its 3-dimensional structure.

The double-floxed reverse ChR2-YFP or YFP cassette was cloned into a modified version of the pAAV2-MCS vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) carrying the EF-1a promoter and the Woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) to enhance expression. The recombinant AAV vectors were serotyped with AAV1 coat proteins and packaged by the viral vector core at the University of North Carolina. The final viral concentration was 4 x 10^12 virus molecules/mL (by Dot Blot, UNC vector core). This viral construct can now be ordered in single aliquots directly from UNC Vector core as product AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP, at http://genetherapy.unc.edu/services.htm) Implantation of electrode arrays for awake recordings Anaesthesia was induced with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100mg ketamine plus 5mg xylazine per kilogram of body weight i.p.) and maintained with isoflurane through a nose cone mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments). The scalp was opened and a hole was drilled in the skull (0.0 to +1.0mm AP, -1.0 to -2.0mm ML from bregma). Two skull screws were implanted in the opposing hemisphere. Dental adhesive (C&B Metabond, Parkell) was used to fix the skull screws in place and coat the surface of the skull. An array of 16 or 32 microwires (35-��m tungsten wires, 100-��m spacing between wires, 200-��m spacing between rows; Innovative Physiology) and one optical fiber in a ferrule was lowered into the striatum (3.0mm below the surface of the brain) and cemented in place with dental acrylic (Ortho-Jet, Lang Dental). After the cement dried, the scalp was sutured shut. Animals were allowed to recover for at least seven days before striatal recordings were made. In vivo electrophysiology Voltage signals from each recording site on the microwire array were band-pass-filtered, such that activity between 150 and 8,000Hz was analysed as spiking activity. This data was amplified, processed and digitally captured using commercial hardware and software (Plexon). Single units were discriminated with principal component analysis (OFFLINE SORTER, Plexon). Two criteria were used to ensure quality of recorded units: (1) recorded units smaller than 100��V (~3 times the noise band) were excluded from further analysis and (2) recorded units in which more than 1% of interspike intervals were shorter than 2ms were excluded from further analysis. Average waveforms were exported with OFFLINE SORTER. During the recording we coupled the array to a laser and pulsed the laser at four intensities (0.1mW, 0.3mW, 1mW, and 3mW). Laser stimulation was run in a cyclical fashion, on for 1 second, and off for 3 seconds. Each neuron received 100 pulses at each laser intensity. Identification of ChR2 expressing units in in vivo recordings For all neurons, peri-event histograms were generated for each laser intensity independently. Neurons were classified as ChR2-expressing if they exhibited a firing rate greater than 3x above the standard deviation of the 1-second preceding the laser pulse within 10msec of the laser onset. Each neuron was tested independently at each laser power, and neurons that satisfied this criteria at any one power were defined as ChR2-expression."},{"ASPGD":"SCR:002047"},{"ASPREE Healthy Ageing Biobank":"SCR:013073"},{"ASPicDB":"SCR:002102"},{"ASSOCIATIONVIEWER":"SCR:009063"},{"ASTER":"SCR:010478"},{"ASTRAL Compendium for Sequence and Structure Analysis":"SCR:001886"},{"ASU CLAS Goldwater Environmental Laboratory":"SCR:011049"},{"ASprofile":"SCR:001833"},{"AStalavista":"SCR:001815"},{"ATASSIA DI FRIEDREICH - PROGETTI 2006":"SCR:008391"},{"ATCC":"SCR:001672"},{"ATGC: Montpellier bioinformatics platform":"SCR:002917"},{"ATID: Alternative Translational Initiation Database":"SCR:009432"},{"ATRHUNTER":"SCR:006480"},{"ATandT Labs Research - Software Tools":"SCR:002937"},{"AU-RICH ELEMENT-CONTAINING mRNA DATABASE":"SCR:012978"},{"AUTO-MUTE":"SCR:013033"},{"AUTOSCAN":"SCR:013510"},{"AVIA":"SCR:005172"},{"AXA Research Fund":"SCR:005276"},{"AbMiner":"SCR:014544"},{"AbMining ToolBox":"SCR:000090"},{"Abbott Diagnostics":"SCR:008392"},{"Abbreviated Mental Test Score":"Double- and triple-labeling experiments, Acquisition of high-resolution images: 2048 x 2048 pixels, Single molecule visualization, allowing dynamic observation and functional analyses of both in vivo and living cells, Total internal reflection fluorescence experiments (TIRF). <BR/> <BR/>This Core consists of a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal laser confocal microscope with a Zeiss RGB vario laser module and Nikon C1 Confocal/TIRF System with 3 PMT.

Through the support of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), we have been able to use NHPs to develop ground-breaking treatments for diseases and conditions such as AIDS, depression, obesity, premature delivery, and cancer. -Enhance interdisciplinary biomedical research by engaging a broad scientific community. They have established Working Groups to enrich their current and future understanding in Stem Cell &amp; Developmental Biology, Biology of Aging, and Metabolic Disease research. Their Collaborative Research Unit helps track and coordinate research projects to ensure we investigate the most relevant and cutting-edge technologies and research methods. -Serve as a model for humane and responsible animal care. Their dedicated team of veterinary and husbandry experts provides unparalleled animal care that meets the highest ethical standards. To ensure that they fulfill their commitment of conducting and promoting research with the utmost integrity, they have dedicated the Division of Animal Resources to oversee all of their animal care programs. With this approach, they''ve been able to expand their behavioral enrichment program, create more effective group housing, and improve the overall health and well being of our primates. -Provide world-class research training and enrichment programs for the future generation of scientific leaders. They believe that part of their progress is due to our participation in a number of educational programsfrom the elementary to post-doctorate levels. Their faculty members engage in training grants and other opportunities to educate students and the community. And in the last nine years, they''ve hosted tours for hundreds of people who have gained a greater appreciation of the important role of our National Primate Research Center and its impact on human health. As one of the eight National Primate Research Centers in the United States, our mandate as a Center is to provide Nonhuman Primate (NHP) resources for the very best scientific programs, both within the Oregon Health &amp; Science University community and beyond. The ONPRC has a unique identity linked to its particular mix of research emphases and nonhuman primate colonies. They have developed models in the monkeys they study that allow them to ask key questions about aging, metabolic diseases like diabetes, reproductive enhancement, and many others. Much of this opportunity is due to their multi-generational, pedigreed colonies that started to breed here in the early 1960s. In each of the three Divisions, there are world-class research programs that relate to high-priority medical needs that are expected to increase in importance and funding emphasis over the coming decades. These include research in aging, AIDS, depression, infectious diseases, substance abuse, obesity, reproductive health, and stem cells. Their role is to perform basic research than can inform new treatments or vaccines, and they also have an emphasis on translational researchto encourage development of the most advanced ideas into clinical testing. This side of their research is greatly facilitated by the resources, expertise, and unique capabilities at the ONPRC and their partners at Oregon Health &amp; Science University. In the pages included here, they have endeavored to give readers a taste of the exciting science they do and how they think it will improve human health. For the general public, we encourage you to explore the About ONPRC tab, as well as Caring for our Animals and Public Outreach.

D: This category includes proteins responsible for facilitating the distribution of drugs from the systemic system to the target sites or away from the target sites back to the systemic system. Certain plasma proteins and intracellular binding proteins may alter free drug concentration by acting as drug storage depot. These proteins thus play a regulatory role in drug distribution and they are thus included in Category D. Based on their role in drug distribution, proteins in this category can be further divided into three groups D1, D2, and D3. The first group D1 includes transporters capable of transporting chemicals across membranes of various tissue barriers from the systemic system into the target sites. Blood-brain barrier and placenta barrier are examples of tissue barrier. Proteins in the second group D2 are responsible for transporting drugs back into the systemic system. Proteins in the third group D3 mainly function as drug storage depot. These include ligand binding proteins in plasma and intracellular proteins. M: Proteins in category M are drug-metabolizing enzymes. These enzymes can be further divided into two separate groups M1 and M2, according to whether the corresponding enzymatic reaction is phase I or phase II. E: This category E includes proteins that enable the excretion or presystemic elimination of drugs. Some proteins belong to more than one category: e.g. P-glycoprotein both limits intestinal absorption and excludes drugs from the brain back to the blood. It thus belongs to both Category E and D.

This site has been dubbed Neuroshare. The home page can be found at neuroshare.sourceforge.net.(3) An open, standardized API library definition for accessing neurophysiology data files. This will allow developers to produce analysis programs that can access a variety of proprietary data formats through libraries supplied by the data format owners. The manner of support will be completely determined by the research groups and vendors that supply the libraries. The Phase I standard was created by a working group consisting of international members from industry and academia. Draft standards were published for public review and comment on the neuroshare web site and revised by the working group.The grant has been awarded as a fast-track program so that Phase II begins immediately upon completion of the Phase I milestones in June 2002. Phase II will produce :(1) A set of neuroshare-compliant API libraries for existing data formats developed in collaboration with individual equipment vendors and research groups.(2) A utility for analyzing compliant API libraries for integrity and specification conformance, as well as for error checking imported data files.(3) A set of template programs in C that are meant to be used as an example on how to create a Neuroshare API compliant library and how to call it from an application,(4) An open, standardized file format for neurophysiological experiment data. This format will provide research groups and vendors with a file format for exchanging and/or publishing neural data. The format will also be powerful enough for use as a native format for researchers or vendors that wish to support it in data acquisition hardware/software.(5) Import filters that interface neuroshare-compliant API libraries to Visual Basic, MATLAB, and LabVIEW, NeuroExplorer, and Stranger analysis environments.(6) A utility program for quick header information viewing and searching to aid the organization and management of data files in the standard and proprietary formats.(7) A data file editing program for reviewing, editing, annotating, and splicing neural data files through the neuroshare API libraries and/or standard file formats. The suite will be developed in C, optimized for speed, and will run within 32-bit Windows operating systems. The availability of source code will enable eventual ports to Unix/Linux if desired(8) An add-on for the editing program that will allow review and real-time playback of multi-modal data accessible through the API and/or standard file format. These modes will include neurophysiological signals such as spikes, local field potentials and EEG, as well as experimental signals such as kinematics, stimulation, audio, video, and imaging data.(9) C and MATLAB framework programs for detection and classification of extracellular spikes in the standard data files based on classical and user-supplied algorithms.(10) A complete MATLAB application for reading data from the standard format and performing reverse correlation analysis. This program will serve as a tutorial and modifiable template for users performing analysis in MATLAB.(11) A set of export filters for creating neurophysiological data files with the neural simulation environments NEURON, NEOSIM, GENESIS, and NSL.(12) A comprehensive documentation, and help file set for all of the developed applications.Phase II will require two years of development work and software products will be made available as they are completed. As stated above, the Phase II software products will be made available as free, open-source tools. We have not decided on a license model yet, but are currently leaning towards the GNU General Public License. Revisions and bug-fixes will be maintained through the neuroshare.org website. The mission of neuroshare.org is very focused, but the specific goal list of Phase II may evolve somewhat as software is released and user feedback is received. We very interested in public suggestions about how to improve this development effort and web site. Please direct your feedback to commentsneuroshare.org or refer to our contacts page for other addresses.BackgroundThis endeavor grew out of a meeting held at the Society for Neuroscience 2000 Annual Conference in New Orleans (agenda posted here) to discuss the development of standard data formats for neuroscience. From this meeting, it was clear that although everyone supported the idea of better data portability, many vendors present wanted a standardized API (Application Program Interface) library rather than a universal data format. Based on this meeting, we submitted an SBIR application (with letters of support from key attendants of the SFN meeting) to fund the development of a standardized API definition, data format, and a suite of open source data handling and review tools."},{"Amides: A Medical Image Data Examiner":"SCR:005940"},{"Amino Acid Index Database":"SCR:007044"},{"Amino Acid Ontology":"SCR:010290"},{"Amino Acid-Nucleotide Interaction Database":"SCR:004617"},{"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase database":"SCR:013498"},{"Amira 3D analysis ":"SCR:014305"},{"AmphibiaWeb":"SCR:001612"},{"Amphibian Gross Anatomy Ontology":"SCR:010291"},{"Amphibian Species of the World":"SCR:008164"},{"Amphibian Taxonomy Ontology":"SCR:000906"},{"AmphoraNet":"SCR:005009"},{"Amplicon":"SCR:003294"},{"AmpliconNoise":"Childhood history and living conditions, education, migration history, marital history, military history, fertility history, language skills, employment history in the US and foreign countries, social networks, religion; Family: Rosters of all children; for each, demographic attributes, education, current work status, migration, marital status and children; for some, summary indicators of childhood and current health, language ability; Economic: Sources and amounts of income, including wages, pensions, and government subsidies; type, value of assets and debts, financial assistance given/received to/from respondent from/to relatives, friends, employer, type of housing and ownership of consumable durables. * Dates of Study: 2003-2007 * Study Features: Longitudinal * Sample Size: 13,981"},{"AmplifX":"SCR:014465"},{"Amplify":"* development, evolution and integration; * implementation and use in databases; and * adoption in data policies by funders and journals.

The phenotypes, that can be selected are grouped by biomarker and are thus available in a number of different facets. Once phenotypes have been selected, the application compares them to canonical phenotypes associated with PIDs in the PID Ontology, by computing a semantic similarity measure. The similarity is determined using a Tanimoto Distance - the more closely related an observed phenotype is to a canonical ontology phenotype, the closer the calculated Tanimoto Distance is to 1 - with increasing dissimilarity, the Tanimoto Coefficient tends towards 0. * The Phenotype Explorer: a rudimentary browser for phenotypes currently contained in the PID Ontology. The browser allows the user to find phenotypes based on biomarker categories and provides some basic definitions (not all definitions are available at this stage) and disease association information. * A Heatmap comparing the phenotypic overlap of PIDs: In essence, the heatmap is a many-to-many comparison of the phenotypic overlap between all Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases contained in the PID Ontology. Again, overlap is calculated using a Tanimoto Distance. The heatmap is a matrix, plotting the Tanimoto coefficients for every PID/PID pair. Increased off-diagonal overlap between PIDs most likely indicates genes in the same pathway. * A Phenotype Frequency Visualization: The phenotype frequency visualization is a simple bar chart indicating how often a particular phenotype is associated with a Primary Immunodeficiency Disease in the Ontology. * A PID Expert map: All of the phenotypes and knowledge contained in the Primary Immunodeficiency Disease Ontology has been extracted from primary clinical or research literature.

One of the questions that the WTCCC study has addressed relates to the relative merits of these alternative strategies for the generation of representative population cohorts. Genotyping for this main Case Control study was conducted by Affymetrix using the (commercial) Affymetrix 500K chip. As part of this study a total of 17,000 samples were typed for 500,000 SNPs. There are two additional components to the study. First, the WTCCC award is part-funding a study of host resistance to infectious diseases in African populations. The same approach has been used to type 2,000 cases of tuberculosis (TB) and 2,000 cases of malaria, as well as 2,000 shared controls. As well as addressing diseases of major global significance, and extending WTCCC coverage into the area of infectious disease, the inclusion of samples of African origin has obvious benefits with respect to methodological aspects of genome-wide association analysis. Second, the WTCCC has, for four additional diseases (autoimmune thyroid disease, breast cancer, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis), completed an analysis of 15,000 SNPs designed to represent a large proportion of the known non-synonymous coding SNPs across the genome. This analysis has been performed at the WTSI using a custom Infinium chip (Illumina). Data release The genotypic data of the control samples (1958 British Birth Cohort and UK Blood Service) and from seven diseases analyzed in the main study are now available to qualified researchers. Summary genotype statistics for these collections are available directly from the website. Access to the individual-level genotype data and summary genotype statistics is by application to the Consortium Data Access Committee (CDAC) and approval subject to a Data Access Agreement. WTCCC2: A further round of GWA studies were funded in April 2008. These include 15 WTCCC-collaborative studies and 12 independent studies be supported totaling approximately 120,000 samples. Many of the studies represent major international collaborative networks that have together assembled large sample collections. WTCCC2 will perform genome-wide association studies in 13 disease conditions: Ankylosing spondylitis, Barrett&#39;s oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma, glaucoma, ischaemic stroke, multiple sclerosis, pre-eclampsia, Parkinson&#39;s disease, psychosis endophenotypes, psoriasis, schizophrenia, ulcerative colitis and visceral leishmaniasis. WTCCC2 will also investigate the genetics of reading and mathematics abilities in children and the pharmacogenomics of statin response. Over 60,000 samples will be analyzed using either the Affymetrix v6.0 chip or the Illumina 660K chip. The WTCCC2 will also genotype 3,000 controls each from the 1958 British Birth cohort and the UK Blood Service control group, and the 6,000 controls will be genotyped on both the Affymetrix v6.0 and Illumina 1.2M chips. WTCCC3: The Wellcome Trust has provided support for a further round of GWA studies in January 2009. These include 5 WTCCC-collaborative studies to be carried out in WTCCC3 and 5 independent studies, across a range of diseases. Many of the studies represent major international collaborative networks that have together assembled large sample collections. WTCCC3 will perform genome-wide association studies in the following 4 disease conditions: primary biliary cirrhosis, anorexia nervosa, pre-eclampsia in UK subjects, and the interactions between donor and recipient DNA related to early and late renal transplant dysfunction. The WTCCC3 will also carry out a pilot in a study of the genetics of host control of HIV-1 infection. Over 40,000 samples will be analyzed using the Illumina 660K chip.

Some applications have plug-ins or libraries available that can read Neuroshare format files, thus making Neuroshare somewhat readily usable. Neuroshare can contain several types of neurophysiological data, but there were no easy tools to convert data into the Neuroshare format, so they made and are providing a Neuroshare Converter Library and Simple Converter using the library. In future work they will make and provide many more useful tools for data sharing. Shared experiments include: EMG signal, Takemiya Exp, Reconstruct (Visual image reconstruction from human brain activity using a combination of multi-scale local image decoders), SPIKE data, Speech Imagery Dataset (Single-trial classification of vowel speech imagery using common spatial patterns), Functional Multineuron Calcium Imaging (fMCI), Rock-paper-scissors (The data was obtained from subject while he make finger-form of rock/paper/scissors).

The sampling frame was constructed on the basis of an advance release of the 2000 US Census. The population for the study consists of the elderly population (60+) in households in Puerto Rico. The sample design used a multistage probabilistic sample by cluster. All elderly adults who lived in the selected households were eligible. If more than one person was in the target population, one 60+ adult was the target and one was the spouse. Respondents 80+ and males in couples who were both 80+ were oversampled. There were 4,293 targets aged 60+ and 1,444 spouses (all ages) in the first wave. Types of data include demographic; household composition; marital history; Cantrill Scale; mini-mental (designed to measure cognitive capacity of Spanish-speaking Latinos with low levels of education and to provide early indications of dementia); self-reported health status; diagnosed health conditions; childhood conditions; transfers; labor history; migration; housing; assets; Activities of Daily Living; Instrumental Activities of Daily Living; medicines; health insurance and use of health services; family structure; sexuality; anthropometric measures. Project innovations include: (1) the design and test of a new tool for assessing cognition among Spanish speaking elderly of low levels of education, (2) a symptoms section to assess the validity of selected self reported conditions, (3) a modification of the Cantrill''s Ladder Scale, (4) protocols for physical measurements to assess current, as well as past, conditions, and (5) the use of GIS and GPS in the fieldwork supervision and to geocoding the survey data. At this moment PREHCO has completed a second wave to become a longitudinal study. The questionnaire included questions regarding the changing conditions (health, residential, social and economic) of those individuals who responded the first questionnaire. The new questionnaire included novel components: vignettes for health status self-report, a new improved section on disability and dependency, and on labor force participation. We also expanded the section of anthropometry by adding a few measurements and physical efficiency tests. Those participants deceased or institutionalized were interviewed using a proxy.

One advantage that HCA has over other algorithms is that instead of producing only the clustering at a given threshold, it produces the set of merges occuring at each threshold. With this approach, the clusters can afterwards very quickly be reported for every arbitrary threshold with little extra computation. This approach also allows the plotting of the variation of number of clusters with clustering threshold without requiring the clustering to be run for each threshold independently. Another feature of the way HPC-CLUST is implemented is that the single-, complete-, and average-linkage clusterings can be computed in a single run with little overhead."},{"Brain Catalogue":"SCR:009442"},{"Brain Coactivation Map":"SCR:014172"},{"Brain Computer Interface 2000 Software Package":"SCR:007346"},{"Brain Connection":"SCR:008315"},{"Brain Connectivity Toolbox":"SCR:004841"},{"Brain Decoder Toolbox":"SCR:013150"},{"Brain Dynamics Centre":"SCR:001685"},{"Brain Entropy Mapping Toolbox":"SCR:014470"},{"Brain Entropy in space and time (BEst)":"SCR:014090"},{"Brain Evolution in the News":"SCR:000592"},{"Brain Explorer Atlas and Teaching Tool":"SCR:013022"},{"Brain Extraction Tool":"SCR:014586"},{"Brain Facts":"SCR:008788"},{"Brain Gene Expression Database":"SCR:007299"},{"Brain Gene Expression Map":"SCR:001517"},{"Brain Health Registry":"SCR:010230"},{"Brain Injury Alliance of Kentucky":"SCR:004764"},{"Brain Injury Association of America":"SCR:006639"},{"Brain Injury Association of Utah":"SCR:005038"},{"Brain Innovation: Home of the BrainVoyager Product Family":"SCR:006660"},{"Brain Machine Interface Platform":"SCR:001813"},{"Brain Mysteries":"SCR:000504"},{"Brain Networks":"SCR:005841"},{"Brain Observatory":"SCR:010641"},{"Brain Operation Database":"SCR:003050"},{"Brain Pharmacological Database":"SCR:003042"},{"Brain Products EEG/fMRI Hardware":"SCR:009443"},{"Brain Research Institute":"SCR:004988"},{"Brain Research Institute Biobank Resources":"SCR:008756"},{"Brain Research Trust":"SCR:004678"},{"Brain Research: Analysis of Images, Networks and Systems":"SCR:007357"},{"Brain Resource":"SCR:006172"},{"Brain Resource Company":"SCR:008019"},{"Brain Science Podcast":"SCR:004491"},{"Brain Segmentation Testing Protocol":"SCR:009445"},{"Brain Test":"SCR:006212"},{"Brain Transcriptome Database":"SCR:014457"},{"Brain Trauma Foundation":"SCR:000108"},{"Brain Tumor Action Network":"SCR:004733"},{"Brain Tumor Foundation For Children":"SCR:004735"},{"Brain Tumor Funders Collaborative":"SCR:005104"},{"Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada":"SCR:004158"},{"Brain Windows":"SCR:001226"},{"Brain and Behavior Research Foundation":"SCR:001992"},{"Brain and Body Donation Program":"SCR:004822"},{"Brain and Body Genetic Resource Exchange":"SCR:008959"},{"Brain atlas of the common marmoset":"SCR:005135"},{"Brain lesion segmentation tool using SVM":"SCR:002583"},{"Brain-Art Competition":"SCR:005360"},{"Brain-Net":"SCR:005017"},{"BrainBlog":"Clinical Trials Datasets Summaries of Clinical Studies References This part of the database has two main sections: one with summaries of the data from each of the references in HIVDB and one in which every primate immunodeficiency virus sequence in GenBank is annotated according to its presence or absence in HIVDB.

The study title links to the introductory page of the study in the References section. Database Statistics (http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/HIVdbStatistics.html) 2. INTERACTIVE PROGRAMS HIVDB has seven main interactive programs. 1. HIVdb Program Mutation List Analysis Sequence Analysis HIVdb Output Sierra Web Service Release Notes Algorithm Specification Interface (ASI) 2. HIValg Program 3. HIVseq Program 4. Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool 5. Mutation ARV Evidence Listing (MARVEL) 6. ART-AiDE 7. Rega HIV-1 Subtyping tool Three programs in the HIV Drug Resistance Database share a common code base: HIVseq, HIVdb, and HIValg. HIVseq accepts user-submitted protease, RT, and integrase sequences, compares them to the consensus subtype B reference sequence, and uses the differences as query parameters for interrogating the HIV Drug Resistance database (Shafer, D Jung, &amp; B Betts, Nat Med 2000; Rhee SY et al. AIDS 2006). The query result provides users with the prevalence of protease, RT and integrase mutations according to subtype and PI, nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI), non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), and integrase inhibitor (INI) exposure. This allows users to detect unusual sequence results immediately so that the person doing the sequencing can check the primary sequence output while it is still on the desktop. In addition, unexpected associations between sequences or isolates can be discovered by immediately retrieving data on isolates sharing one or more mutations with the sequence. There are three ways in which the HIVdb program can be used: (i) entering a list of protease and RT mutations, (ii) entering a complete sequence containing protease, RT, and/or integrase, and (iii) using a Web Service. HIVdb is an expert system that accepts user-submitted HIV-1 pol sequences and returns inferred levels of resistance to 20 FDA-approved ARV drugs including 8 PIs, 7 NRTIs, 4 NNRTIs, and - with this update - one INI. In the HIVdb system, each HIV-1 drug resistance mutation is assigned a drug penalty score and a comment; the total score for a drug is derived by adding the scores of each mutation associated with resistance to that drug. Using the total drug score, the program reports one of the following levels of inferred drug resistance: susceptible, potential low-level resistance, low-level resistance, intermediate resistance, and high-level resistance. HIValg is designed for users interested in comparing the results of different algorithms or who are interested in comparing and evaluating existing and newly developed algorithms. The ability to develop new algorithms that can be run on the HIV Drug Resistance Database depends on the Algorithm Specific Interface (ASI) compiler (Shafer &amp; Betts JCM 2003). Submission of Sequences and Mutations For each of the three programs, sequences can be entered using either the Sequence Analysis Form or the Mutation List form. 3. EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES HIVDB contains several regularly updated sections summarizing data linking RT, protease, and integrase mutations and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). These sections include (i) tabular summaries of the major mutations associated with each ARV class, (ii) detailed summaries of the major, minor, and accessory mutations associated with each ARV, (iii) the comments used by the HIVdb program, (iv) the scores used by the HIVdb program, (v) clinical studies in which baseline drug resistance mutations have been correlated with the virological response (clinical outcome) to a specific ARV, (vi) mutations that can be used for drug resistance surveillance, and (vii) a two-page PDF handout. 1.

Abstract. Indo-European is the largest and best-documented language family in the world, yet the reconstruction of the Indo-European tree, first proposed in 1863, has remained controversial. Complications may include ascertainment bias when choosing the linguistic data, and disregard for the wave model of 1872 when attempting to reconstruct the tree. Essentially analogous problems were solved in evolutionary genetics by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic network methods, respectively. We now adapt these tools to linguistics, and analyze Indo-European language data, focusing on Celtic and in particular on the ancient Celtic language of Gaul (modern France), by using bilingual GaulishLatin inscriptions. Our phylogenetic network reveals an early split of Celtic within Indo-European. Interestingly, the next branching event separates Gaulish (Continental Celtic) from the British (Insular Celtic) languages, with Insular Celtic subsequently splitting into Brythonic (Welsh, Breton) and Goidelic (Irish and Scottish Gaelic). Taken together, the network thus suggests that the Celtic language arrived in the British Isles as a single wave (and then differentiated locally), rather than in the traditional two-wave scenario (P-Celtic to Britain and Q-Celtic to Ireland). The phylogenetic network furthermore permits the estimation of time in analogy to genetics, and we obtain tentative dates for Indo-European at 8100 BC 1,900 years, and for the arrival of Celtic in Britain at 3200 BC 1,500 years. The phylogenetic method is easily executed by hand and promises to be an informative approach for many problems in historical linguistics."},{"CAST":"SCR:000628"},{"CASVM":"SCR:001121"},{"CASY Cell Counter and Analyser System Model TT":"SCR:002080"},{"CAT":"SCR:008421"},{"CATCHprofiles":"SCR:001182"},{"CATH: Protein Structure Classification":"SCR:007583"},{"CATIE - Alzheimer&#39;s Disease":"SCR:005512"},{"CATIE - Clinical Antipsychotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness":"SCR:005615"},{"CATMA - Complete Arabidopsis Transcriptome MicroArray":"SCR:007578"},{"CATMAID":"SCR:006278"},{"CATS":"SCR:009139"},{"CATSS - Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden":"SCR:005945"},{"CATdb: a Complete Arabidopsis Transcriptome database":"http://renux.dmed.ed.ac.uk/ http://en.wikipedia.org/ http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov http://www.webmd.com HUS HUS (Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome) is a disease associated with microangiopathic haemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. A subgroup of the syndrome is strongly associated with abnormalities within the complement regulator factor H gene. To read information on HUS click here. To read information on Factor H (FH) click here. FH Mutations There are currently 74 Factor H mutations, 10 Factor I mutations and 25 MCP mutations linked with HUS patients within this database. There are also 5 mutations within FH that are associated with MPGN patients. . Following HGVS guidelines, mutations are numbered starting from the ATG initiation codon and include the 18-residue signal peptide. The number of the codon with respect to the mature FH protein and consistent with the RSCB PDB entry for secreted FH (1haq.pdb) is shown alongside in parenthesis. Type I and Type II Phenotype Type I indicates that the mutant protein is either absent from the plasma or present in lower amounts. This indicates the mutation has a structural effect on the mutant protein - ie reducing the stability Type II indicates that the mutant protein is present in normal amounts in plasma. This indicates that the mutation has a functional effect on the protein ie affecting substrate binding References There are three references you can use to reference this database Saunders et al, 2007.

BACKGROUND: cblC disease is a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which has been primarily described in neonates and infants with severe renal and neurological lesions. PATIENTS: Two sisters aged 6 and 8.5 years presented with a latent hemolytic process characterized by undetectable or low plasma haptoglobin, respectively, associated with renal failure and gross proteinuria. Renal biopsies performed in both patients found typical findings of thrombotic microangiopathy suggesting the diagnosis of HUS. Both patients were free of neurologic signs. RESULTS: Biochemical investigations found a cobalamin processing deficiency of the cblC type. Search for additional factors susceptible to worsen endothelial damage revealed homozygosity 677C--&gt; T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene as well as heterozygosity for a 3254T--&gt; C mutation in factor H in the patient with the most severe clinical presentation. Long-term subcutaneous administration of hydroxocobalamin in combination with oral betaine and folic acid resulted in clinical and biological improvement in both patients. CONCLUSION: cblC disease may be a cause of chronic HUS with delayed onset in childhood. Superimposed mutation of factor H gene might influence clinical severity."},{"CAU CCRTD-Cell Biology":"SCR:009691"},{"CAU CCRTD-Histology Core":"SCR:009412"},{"CAU CCRTD-Molecular Biology":"SCR:009692"},{"CAU CCRTD-Proteomics":"SCR:009687"},{"CAU CCRTD-Structural Biology":"Imperial College London , University College London and the European Bioinformatics Institute . e-Protein''s mission statement is To provide a fully automated distributed pipeline for large-scale structural and functional annotation of all major proteomes via the use of cutting-edge computer GRID technologies.

Although originally designed for expressing proteins in Xenopus embryos from either injected RNA or DNA, pCS2 is also useful for high-level transient expression in a wide variety of mammalian and avian cells. It is also functional in zebrafish embryos (as DNA or RNA), and it can be used for in vitro transcription/translation (using, for example, the Promega TnT system). A number of derivatives of CS2 have been constructed that allow fusions to epitope tags and other marker proteins, as well as nuclear localization signals or the gal4 DNA binding and activation domains. In almost all cases, the same reading frames are used for the fusion vectors, to facilitate moving genes between multiple CS2 derivatives. pCS2 features: pCS2 contains a strong enhancer/promoter (simian CMV IE94) followed by a polylinker and the SV40 late polyadenlyation site. An SP6 promoter is present in the 5'' untranslated region of the mRNA from the sCMV promoter, allowing in vitro RNA synthesis of sequences cloned into the polylinker. A T7 promoter in reverse orientation between the polylinker and the SV40 polyA site for probe synthesis, as well as a second polylinker after the SV40 polyA site to provide several possible sites to linearize the vector for SP6 RNA transcription.

Finally, by involving clinical and industrial stakeholders, VPH NoE also plans to lay a reliable ground to support sustainable interactions and collaboration between research and healthcare communities. Virtual Physiological Human lists, as its main target outcome, patient-specific computer models for personalized and predictive healthcare and ICT-based tools for modeling and simulation of human physiology and disease-related processes. Collaborative projects (IPs and STREPs) within the call will meet specific objectives, addressing: patient-specific computational modeling and simulation of organs or systems data integration and new knowledge extraction and clinical applications and demonstration of tangible benefits of patient-specific computational models. The networking action outlined within the call - the VPH NoE - should serve to connect these efforts, and lay the foundations for the methodological and technical framework to support such research. It should also build on previous EC investment in this field, including the outcomes of VPH type'' projects funded within the EU Sixth Framework Programme, and through other National and International initiatives. The Virtual Physiological Human Network of Excellence (VPH NoE) has been designed with ''service to the community'' of VPH researchers as its primary purpose. Its aims range from the development of a VPH ToolKit and associated infrastructural resources, through integration of models and data across the various relevant levels of physiological structure and functional organization, to VPH community building and support. The VPH NoE aims to foster the development of new and sustainable educational, training and career structures for those involved in VPH related science, technology and medicine. The VPH NoE constitutes a leading group of universities, institutes and organizations who will, by integrating their experience and ongoing activities in VPH research, promote the creation of an environment that actively supports and nurtures interdisciplinary research, education, training and strategic development. The VPH NoE will lead the coordination of diverse activities within the VPH Initiative to help deliver: new environments for predictive, patient-specific, evidence-based, more effective and safer healthcare; improved semantic interoperability of biomedical information and contribution to a common health information infrastructure; facile, on-demand access to distributed European computational infrastructure to support clinical decision making; and increased European multidisciplinary research excellence in biomedical informatics and molecular medicine by fostering closer cooperation between ICT, medical device, medical imaging, pharmaceutical and biotech companies. The VPH NoE will connect the diverse VPH Initiative projects, including not only those funded as part of the VPH initiative but also those of previous EC frameworks and national funding schemes, together with industry, healthcare providers, and international organizations, thereby ensuring that these impacts will be realized. VPH NoE work packages and project structure The VPH NoE activities are divided between five main work packages (follow the links at the top of the page for more information on each). In brief, the focus of each work package is as follows: -Work package 1: Network Management -Work package 2: VPH NoE Exemplar Projects -Work package 3: VPH NoE ToolKit development -Work package 4: VPH NoE Training and Career Development -Work package 5: Spreading Excellence within the VPH NoE and VPH-I In view of its role as the networking action for the VPH Initiative, all VPH NoE activities have been designed to serve and interconnect not only the VPH NoE core members, but also the projects funded within the VPH call (VPH-I) and the wider research community. Key activities which the VPH NoE will pursue, in support of the development of a research environment which facilitates integrative, interdisciplinary and multilevel VPH research, are: -Support for integrative research -Training and dissemination activities -Networking activities Sponsors: VPH NoE is supported by The Directorate-General Research (DG RTD) and The Directorate-General Information Society and Media (DG INFSO)."},{"Cell Line Authentication Testing":"SCR:014504"},{"Cell Line Knowledge Base":"SCR:005832"},{"Cell Line Ontology":"SCR:005840"},{"Cell Line Ontology by Mahadevan":"SCR:010281"},{"Cell Podcasts":"SCR:005846"},{"Cell Properties Database":"SCR:007285"},{"Cell Signaling Pathways":"SCR:002070"},{"Cell Signaling Technology Pathway Database":"SCR:002071"},{"Cell Signaling and Neuroscience: Pathway Slides and Charts":"SCR:002069"},{"Cell Type Ontology":"tissue type, p-value, cis/trans, probeset Affymetrix id and PQTL type.

Basic research is giving new information on how the brain works and how brain injury occurs-and how it can be prevented or improved. Recognizing the exciting opportunities now available to better understand nervous system function and to design new treatments for neurological diseases, we''ve developed an interdepartmental program: The Clinical Neuroscience Pathway to provide an enhanced exposure to the neurosciences while pursuing the Doctor of Medicine degree. Program goal: The Clinical Neuroscience Pathway provides medical students with an enriched experience in the neurosciences throughout their four years in medical school. This program will provide students interested in Neurology, Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, Pathology, or Psychiatry with access to a number of stimulating clinical and research activities. In addition, students will have the opportunity to participate in activities specifically designed for medical students in the program. Pathway students will be eligible for special summer research and year-out opportunities for clinical and basic neuroscience study. John N. Whitaker Visiting Professorships About the Program The ANA offers up to five 5,000 awards annually to fund visits of several days duration by persons who will interact with medical students and by both formal and informal contacts, stimulate them to consider academic neurology careers. The ideal visitor will be a role model of an accomplished academician who is enthusiastic and will effectively illustrate the applications between basic science and clinical neurology. The ANAs Education Committee must approve the visitor. The inviting institution should have acceptance from the visitor prior to submitting the name. The ANA suggests that an honorarium in the amount of 2,000 be given to the visitor. Special consideration will be given to institutions with small departments, but this is not a requirement. The Whitaker Professorships are intended to honor the life and contributions of John N. Whitaker M.D. (1940 - 2001) whose life and career exemplified high achievement as a person, neurological physician, teacher, investigator, mentor and citizen."},{"Center for Cancer Research: Schiller Laboratory":"* Supporting its partners as they secure funding for specific, data-driven projects * Securing funding for sustainable DELSA core and community-wide operations * Consulting with researchers and innovators on initiative development and funding strategies * Arranging resources for connective and translational initiatives * Monitoring, measuring and reporting on the progress and impact of initiative outcomes Strategy: * Identifying, inspiring and supporting new modes of business and innovation * Providing a leading voice and coordinating framework for collective innovation in data-enabled science for the life sciences community * Promoting sustainable and shared access to data, knowledge, tools, and services * Facilitating information exchange through workshop development, community involvement and publications * Identifying and cultivating opportunities to create essential solutions by implementing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches * Coordinating and monitoring individual initiatives focused on translational impact"},{"Center for Cell Analysis and Modeling":"SCR:013656"},{"Center for Comparative Medicine":"SCR:008294"},{"Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research":"SCR:008299"},{"Center for Computational Biology at UCLA":"SCR:000334"},{"Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry":"SCR:008161"},{"Center for Computational Medicine and Biology":"SCR:001975"},{"Center for Disease Control and Prevention: Genetic Testing Reference Materials Coordination Program":"SCR:013029"},{"Center for EPR Imaging in Vivo Physiology":"SCR:001410"},{"Center for Functional Neuroimaging Technologies":"R82-R83).

Proposals in support of animal efficacy studies or synthesis and formulation of recombinant proteins or monoclonal antibodies will not be accepted. NIH-RAID is not a grant program. Successful projects will gain access to the governments contract resources, as well as the assistance of the NIH in establishing and implementing a product development plan. Funds to support individual projects will come both from the Roadmap and from individual Institutes, with Institutes assuming the bulk of support in the specific disease areas germane to their mission. This co-sponsorship is critical because of the resource and expertise needs and because NIH-RAID cannot support the full developmental pipeline; an Institute partnership may therefore be important for subsequent translational efforts. To obtain access to NIH-RAID resources, applications must be submitted electronically through Grants.gov using SF424. Applications are initially screened to determine whether the resources requested are appropriate for this program. Then they are reviewed by the NIH Center for Scientific Research. The results of that evaluation along with supplemental information from the lead investigator will guide final Institute and Roadmap resource allocation. The services provided will depend upon the stage of the project and the strength of the preliminary data.

This project, PhenX (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures) used a consensus process to identify 15 high priority measures for each of 21 broad research domains. The PhenX Toolkit presents the measures and protocols free of charge to the scientific community in a web-based resource (https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/). The Toolkit provides a brief description of each measure, the purpose and rationale for its inclusion, the standard protocols for collecting the data, and references; it also describe the requirements (e.g., training, personnel, equipment, any applicable licensing fees) for data collection. Widespread adoption of PhenX measures will promote scientific collaboration, accelerate validation studies, and lead to new insights and identification of shared underlying mechanisms in health and disease.

Network Viewer shows network architecture and processing in real- time, allows network to be constructed with simple point-and-click actions. Training and testing data can be graphed on-line and network state can be displayed over time numerically or using a wide range of color or size-based graphical representations. Environment Viewer shows training patterns using color or size-based graphical representations; interactive configuration. Flexible object-oriented design allows mix-and-match simulation construction and easy extension by deriving new object types from existing ones. Built-in ''CSS'' scripting language uses C++ syntax, allows full access to simulation object data and functions. Transition between script code and compiled code is simplified since both are C++. Script has command-line completion, source-level debugger, and provides standard C/C++ library functions and objects. Scripts can control processing, generate training and testing patterns, automate routine tasks, etc. Scripts can be generated from GUI actions, and the user can create GUI interfaces from script objects to extend and customize the simulation environment. Distributed memory parallel processing (via MPI), allows substantial speedups by distributed processing (over connections, events, and training batches) over multiple processes. Supported Algorithms Include: Feedforward and recurrent error backpropagation. Recurrent BP includes continuous, real-time models, and Almeida-Pineda. Constraint satisfaction algorithms and associated learning algorithms including Boltzmann Machine, Hopfield models, mean-field networks (DBM), Interactive Activation and Competition (IAC), and continuous stochastic networks.

The comparison of the proteome of Tetraodon with those of mammals has revealed some interesting differences, such as a major diversification of some hormone systems and of the collagen molecules in the fish. A search for transposable elements in the genomic sequences of Tetraodon has also revealed a high diversity (75 types), which contrasts with their scarcity; the small size of the Tetraodon genome is due to the low abundance of these elements, of which some appear to still be active. Another factor in the compactness of the Tetraodon genome, which has been confirmed by annotation, is the reduction in intron size, which approaches a lower limit of 50-60 bp, and which preferentially affects certain genes. The availability of the sequences from the genomes of humans and mice on one hand, and Takifugu and Tetraodon on the other, provide new opportunities for the study of vertebrate evolution. We have shown that the level of neutral evolution is higher in fish than in mammals. The protein sequences of fish also diverge more quickly than those of mammals. A key mechanism in evolution is gene duplication, which we have studied by taking advantage of the anchoring of the majority of the sequences from the assembly on the chromosomes. The result of this study speaks strongly in favor of a whole genome duplication event, very early in the line of ray-finned fish (Actinopterygians). An even stronger evidence came from synteny studies between the genomes of humans and Tetraodon. Using a high-resolution synteny map, we have reconstituted the genome of the vertebrate which predates this duplication - that is, the last common ancestor to all bony vertebrates (most of the vertebrates apart from cartilaginous fish and agnaths like lamprey). This ancestral karyotype contains 12 chromosomes, and the 21 Tetraodon chromosomes derive from it by the whole genome duplication and a surprisingly small number of interchromosomal rearrangements. On the contrary, exchanges between chromosomes have been much more frequent in the lineage that leads to humans.

Then, more sophisticated programs are recommended. Another program for estimating haplotype frequencies is SNPHAP. It is very flexible although it is restricted to analyzing bi-allelic markers. Also, PHASE is very useful for estimating haplotype frequencies and for inferring haplotypes to individuals. See Marchini et al. (2006). Files in this package (Windows): EH.PAS: Source code of EH program. EH.EXE: Executable code of EH program, which is compiled with a maximum of 30 alleles per locus, 10 loci, 1000 haplotypes, and 3600 genotype patterns (product of numbers of genotypes at each locus). EH.DAT, EH.OUT, etc: Sample input and output files. Input file The EH program does not require additional programs although you need a Pascal compiler (Free Pascal) to recompile the program when you change program constants. There is one input file whose name the user can determine, for example, EH.DAT (this is the default name). It contains the numbers of alleles for each marker and the observations for each genotype. First line: Number of alleles at the first marker, number of alleles at the second marker, and so on. Assuming you have 2 markers, the first marker has 2 alleles and the second marker has 3, you write 2 3 in the first line. The order of markers in the remainder of the input file is determined by the order of markers you entered in the first line. Subsequent lines: Number of observations for given genotypes. These numbers must be arranged as follows: The number of columns is the number of the possible genotypes at the last locus. Let M be the number of alleles at the last locus, then the number of the possible genotypes equals M(M 1)/2. For example, if the last locus has two alleles, then there are 3 possible genotypes which are 1/1, 1/2 and 2/2. Therefore, in each row there are 3 columns corresponding to the genotypes 1/1, 1/2, 2/2. Similarly, if the last marker has three alleles, then there are 6 columns corresponding to 1/1, 1/2, 2/2, 1/3, 2/3, 3/3. The number of rows is the product of the number of the possible genotypes at the first (N - 1) markers, where N is the total number of markers. That is, no. of rows = L1(L1 1)/2 L2(L2 1)/2 ... Li(Li 1)/2 ..., where Li is the number of alleles at the i-th locus. For example, assume you have 3 loci and the first and the second locus each have 2 alleles, and the third locus has 3 alleles. Thus, there are 6 columns and 9 rows (see example 1 below). However, if the first locus has 3 alleles and the second and third have 2 alleles each, there are 18 rows and 3 columns. The output file from the EH program, EH.OUT by default, contains the estimated haplotype frequencies and their corresponding log likelihoods.

The widespread availability of such models is critically important to making progress against a disorder that affects more than 500,000 Americans at any given time. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) fully recognizes the burden placed on investigators by the financial and logistical realities of distributing high demand research resources. Some investigators have deposited their mice with national distribution facilities but many mouse models are not available through such resources. Developing means to facilitate greater sharing of mouse models of PD is one of the goals developed by the PD research community at the July 2002 summit meeting convened by the NIH Director. Accordingly, as part of the effort to accelerate PD research, NINDS and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) created a resource that will distribute transgenic mouse models of human PD that are not yet available through national commercial resources. Investigators who are willing to share mice with the PD research community can simply arrange with NINDS to have the mice deposited at UCLA and investigators desiring to study the mice may arrange with NINDS to obtain two breeding pairs.

Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel. Linux is a piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. FreeBSD is an operating system including a kernel and other software. However, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project. A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free. Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 29000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine) all of it free. It''s a bit like a tower.

Solid tissues are usually snap frozen in the surgical pathology suite, although investigators may request alternate preservation methods. Blood specimens are generally processed to frozen serum aliquots and peripheral leukocyte cell pellets. Other specimens (e.g. lymph node needle aspirations) that may be obtained in a variety of other patient care areas can be collected and processed immediately by a staff member who is on call at all times to receive specimens. * Archival Frozen Tissue Bank: For investigators desiring immediate access to material for molecular and histological studies, an archive of over 18,000 frozen human biospecimens is available. Specimens include solid tumors, patient-matched non-malignant tissue, serum, and peripheral blood leukocytes. Each specimen is accompanied with basic patient demographic information and pathology diagnostic data. Generally, each frozen tissue specimen is reviewed to confirm that the specimen is representative of the written pathology diagnosis. Investigators may request frozen tissue sections for immunohistochemical analysis, genomic DNA, protein extracts, or cellular RNA derived from any specimen in the archive. * RNA Assessment: Cellular RNA prepared by the Core from banked specimens or any other RNA submitted by investigators can be qualitatively assessed by Agilent Bioanalyzer capillary microelectrophoresis and quantified by fiberoptic spectrophotometry, prior to use for downstream applications such as microarray or qRT-PCR analysis. * Laser Capture Microdissection: Pure cell populations are often needed for clonality, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), gene mutation, and mRNA expression analysis studies. The Core''s Pixcell II Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) instrument can be used to dissect pure populations of cells from heterogeneous tissue sections. The instrument greatly enhances the speed and ease of dissection as compared to traditional manual methods. The instrument is available for use to investigators who wish to microdissect cells from either specimens stored in the Tissue Procurement Core or their own sets of collected tissue specimens."},{"EMDataBank.org: Unified Data Resource for Cryo Electron Microscopy":"SCR:003207"},{"EMGlib - Enhanced Microbial Genomes Library":"SCR:007638"},{"EMI":"SCR:001171"},{"EMIF":"SCR:010495"},{"EMINIM":"SCR:010790"},{"EMLD":"SCR:009171"},{"EMMA":"SCR:006136"},{"EMMA2":"Study management service, Administrative and financial support, Regulatory support. <BR/> <BR/>The Clinical Trials Office (CTO) supports clinical research study initiation and conduct, including assurance of regulatory and financial compliance.

We use inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for metals analysis and several ?hyphenated? techniques that couple instruments together for speciation analyses of water, soil and biological tissue samples. The lab has three ICP-MS instruments (Agilent 7700x, Agilent 7500cx, and Element 2 ICP-MS). We can measure most elements in the periodic table with detection limits in the low ppt range or below. Our ICP-MS instruments can also be coupled with cold vapor generation, liquid chromatography and laser ablation. With these hyphenated analyses we can * Detect ultra-low levels of arsenic or mercury (< 1 ng/L) * Differentiate between toxic and nontoxic forms, or species, of arsenic and mercury * Map trace elements within a biological tissue We are interested in new methods and new applications for hyphenated analyses. This includes work in the emerging field of metallomics, which characterizes all of the metal binding molecules in a cell, in blood, or in an organism. The TEA lab supports Dartmouth College researchers in the Superfund Basic Research Program: Toxic Metals in the Northeast. We work especially closely with Superfund Basic Research Program Project 4 Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Exposure Assessment of Metals and Project 7 Bioaccumulation and Trophic Transfer of Toxic Metals in Aquatic Food Webs. For Project 4, we speciate arsenic and provide total concentrations from samples of water and urine. For Project 7, we measure levels of mercury and other metals in freshwater aquatic food webs.

The name extractor is based on existing dictionaries of gene names and aliases. The mining algorithm analyses the co-occurrences of words in the selected documents in order to automatically interpret the context, identify where the gene names appear, and map documents/genes into functional classes. Microarray transcriptional profiling is a powerful tool used in the study of transcriptional control mechanisms. An important point in the analysis of microarray data is the identification of hidden correlations between the differentially expressed genes generated upon some kind of cell stimulus. Functional annotation is an important topic for microarray data mining, however this is quite limited for complex organisms (e.g. H. sapiens, M. musculus) where a limited number of genes are well characterized and annotated. However, functional data are rapidly accumulating in the scientific literature and most of them are collected by MEDLINE, a database that contains over 11,000,000 biomedical journal citations. A microarray analysis usually generates few hundred of differentially expressed genes and, after statistical validation of the data and transcription profiles clustering, biologists try to identify genes functionally correlated by scientific literature analysis. Even if some tools have been recently developed to simplify information extraction on the MEDLINE database, reading every article requires too much time and labor. Therefore, it is necessary to have some kind of intelligent information extracting system that recognizes gene names inside the texts. The analysis of text documents (e.g. MEDLINE abstracts) can be approached by two different points of view: text mining and information extraction (I.E.). The former aims at the automatic identification of groups of documents that share the same patterns of words, and thus refer to the same topic or theme. The latter aims at providing a structured representation of the textual information and requires a pre-definition of entities and relationships to be looked for inside texts. Thus while the text mining algorithms are general purpose, the information extraction algorithms are specific to the application. Furthermore, the text mining approach is explorative and enables the discovery of new concepts and relations while information extraction only extracts those elements that have already been defined. These two approaches can be integrated: information extraction tools generate databases that can be analyzed using data mining techniques, and, on the other side, text mining tools might take advantage of specific domain information extracted using I.E. techniques. MedMOLE takes advantage of text mining techniques, and simplifies the extraction of functional knowledge by literature abstracts directly/indirectly related to differentially expressed genes identified by microarray technology.

Disintegrins are competitive inhibitors of normal integrin function. Disintegrins found in snake venoms are low-molecular-weight polypeptides, most of which have an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence, also known as an RGD region, which is the universal recognition sequence for integrin receptors. The RGD motif in disintegrins can affect the shape, orientation, and movement of cells. Since disintegrins interfere with integrin function on the surface of cells, disintegrins have important applications in the discovery of new drugs for treatment of cancer, heart attacks, and stroke. Compounds in snake venoms are being purified, characterized, and screened for disintegrin-like activities.\\nServices Provided\\nThe Natural Toxins Research Center&#39;s serpentarium currently houses more than 450 venomous snakes representing 29 species, with the goal to eventually include all venomous species from North America. The serpentarium has built-in snake cages with computer-controlled lighting and temperature. Individual snake venoms are collected, lyophilized, and entered into the database. The snakes are cataloged on the Internet database along with their geographical location data, hemorrhagic and proteolytic activities, and HPLC and ET profiles. The VRC provides snake venoms, glands, skins, blood, and organs found in snakes. The database can be queried according to scientific name, common name, sex, and identification number.\\nSponsors: This resource was supported by NTRC (Grant number: P40 RR018300)."},{"GENO3D":"SCR:003183"},{"GENOCHECK":"SCR:009203"},{"GENOGRAM-MAKER":"SCR:008751"},{"GENOME":"SCR:008949"},{"GENOMESIMLA":"SCR:008990"},{"GENOMIZER":"SCR:009127"},{"GENOOM":"SCR:009200"},{"GENOPROOF":"SCR:009204"},{"GENORM":"SCR:006763"},{"GENSAT":"SCR:002721"},{"GENSAT at NCBI - Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas":"SCR:003923"},{"GENSCAN":"SCR:012902"},{"GENSCAN Web Server at MIT":"SCR:013362"},{"GENSENG":"SCR:000378"},{"GENTOOLS":"SCR:009205"},{"GEOSS":"SCR:003401"},{"GEOquery":"SCR:000146"},{"GEPAT":"SCR:003597"},{"GERMLINE":"SCR:001720"},{"GERON":"SCR:008531"},{"GERP":"SCR:000563"},{"GESND":"SCR:005179"},{"GEST":"SCR:009206"},{"GEUVADIS":"SCR:000684"},{"GEVALT":"1990-2000 Links: 1980: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/08101 2000: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/04204"},{"GEneral NEural SImulation System: The Neurospaces Project":"SCR:008035"},{"GFINDer: Genome Function INtegrated Discoverer":"SCR:008868"},{"GGSD":"a null model, in which the foreground branch may have different proportions of sites under neutral selection than the background (i.e. relaxed purifying selection), and an alternative model, in which the foreground branch may have a proportion of sites under positive selection. As the alternative model is the general case, it is easier to present it first. Basic search Basic search accepts diverse entries, including TreeFam family names, Uniprot protein names or accession numbers, Ensembl gene names, or keywords. Advanced research: You can use the advanced search menu to restrict your search to a specific data type and get results faster. You can also use the advanced search menu to perform a search on a specific phylogenetic branch. Branch names follow the NCBI Taxonomy. If Positive selection is selected, the query will search only for subtrees with significant positive selection on the chosen branch. If not selected, the query will search only for subtrees without positive selection on that branch. If Duplication is selected, only branches annotated as a gene duplication will be queried. If not selected, only branches annotated as a speciation event will be queried. Note that the query is done on subtrees, but results return gene families which may contain several subtrees. Thus a query for the Homo/Pan/Gorilla branch with and without positive selection may return some common families, because different subtrees match the query. Selectome does not perform tests on terminal branches, as power of the test is lower, while sequencing or gene prediction errors may be more influential. We urge caution in interpreting results even on non terminal branches for which there are few sequences, such as the Homo/Pan/Gorilla branch shown above. List of results: After a keyword or an external database id search, Selectome provides the results under two types, by family and by gene. Results of positive selection tests: The family datasheet is split into two parts: 1) The description of the family, with accession number, symbol, family name, description (with access to the paper) and synonyms, if any. This is according to TreeFam. and 2) The subtree(s). These are also according to TreeFam, but with added information on positive selection. You can click on gene names to access gene specific data. Nodes appear as blue boxes for speciation events, and red for duplication events. Boxes surrounded by a larger green box are branches under positive selection. Placing the mouse above a node provides information on the type of event (speciation or duplication), the selection with p-value (if available; small p-values are more significant), the taxon, the branch length and the bootstrap (phylogenetic support for the branch, in %; high bootstrap values are more significant)."},{"GGT":"SCR:009208"},{"GHOST":"SCR:009209"},{"GHOSTM":"SCR:000062"},{"GIA Brain Bank Program":"SCR:008877"},{"GIFTI":"SCR:009579"},{"GIMIAS":"SCR:009545"},{"GIMME (Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation)":"SCR:014115"},{"GISTIC":"SCR:000151"},{"GLAD":"SCR:001284"},{"GLARE":"SCR:012083"},{"GLFSINGLE/GLFTRIO/GLFMULTIPLES":"SCR:013128"},{"GLIDA : GPCR-Ligand Database":"SCR:007690"},{"GLIDERS":"This resource is supported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

To understand what makes a cell function normally and what may go awry in disease, we need better tools and resources, such as renewable protein capture reagents and probes, to study how proteins work in isolation and how they interact with other proteins, carbohydrates, or DNA regions within a cell. Ideally, this resource would allow us to identify and isolate all proteins within cells, in their various forms the so called proteome to ensure broad application in research and clinical studies aimed at understanding, preventing, detecting and treating disease. Existing protein capture reagents, such monoclonal antibodies, have been developed for a number of protein targets, although these represent only a subset of all proteins comprising the human proteome. In addition, many monoclonal antibodies lack the desired level of specificity and do not reliably target only the protein of interest. This is particularly problematic given the multiple forms of any one protein and the broad range of protein types in the body. The Protein Capture Reagents Program is organized as a pilot program using transcription factors as a test case to examine the feasibility and value of generating a community resource of low cost, renewable affinity reagents for all human proteins. The reagents must be specifically designed for high quality and broad experimental utility in order to meet the growing demands of biomedical researchers. Based on what is learned from these funding initiatives, the program may expand to a larger production effort to provide a broad community resource of human protein capture reagents."},{"GeneDB Spombe":"SCR:010639"},{"GeneDB Tbrucei":"SCR:004786"},{"GeneExpressionSignature":"SCR:000455"},{"GeneFarm":"SCR:007674"},{"GeneFisher":"* at the gene level: exon and codon number, wild type and mutant codon, mutation event, mutation name and, * at the protein level: wild type and mutant amino acid, binding domain, affected domain.

This design is intended to be platform and vendor-neutral (common denominator is genome sequence coordinates), and is a dynamic process with input from the broader genetics community and evidence-based review by the expert panel (which will evolve into a Standing Committee with international representation). # Public Database for clinical and research community: It is essential that publicly available databases be created and maintained for cytogenetic array data generated in clinical testing laboratories. The ISCA data will be held in dbGaP and dbVar at NCBI/NIH and curated by a committee of clinical genetics laboratory experts. The very high quality of copy number data (i.e., deletions and duplications) coming from clinical laboratories combined with expert curation will produce an invaluable resource to the clinical and research communities. # Standards for interpretation of cytogenetic array results: Using the ISCA Database, along with other genomic and genetics databases, the Consortium will develop recommendations for the interpretation and reporting of pathogenic vs. benign copy number changes as well as imbalances of unknown clinical significance."},{"Healthy People":"SCR:001446"},{"Heart and Calcium Functional Network Database":"SCR:013515"},{"Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Prizes":"England & Wales 1037087 / Scotland: SC041199."},{"Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute":"* Conducting multidisciplinary research to understand how road crashes and the resulting injuries are caused * Proposing and evaluating ways to prevent crashes and injuries * Providing independent professional advice on road safety matters to government and non-government organisations in Australia and overseas The Centre began life in 1973 as the Road Accident Research Unit (RARU) with the planning and undertaking of an in-depth study of road accidents in the Adelaide metropolitan area. From 1981 through 1998, the Unit''s work was supported by a grant from the National Health And Medical Research Council. During that grant period RARU''s research program was concentrated in two areas: the study of brain injury mechanisms in fatally injured road users and the epidemiology of drink driving and alcohol related crashes. Notably, an investigation of the influence of vehicle speed in fatal pedestrian accidents led on to case control studies of the relationship between a driver''s travelling speed and risk of involvement in a casualty crash in both urban and rural areas. RARU''s analysis of the occurrence of brain injury in road crashes called into question the then prevailing paradigm of brain injury mechanisms. This prompted the development of an experimental study of axonal injury that, in turn, led to the Japan Automobile Research Institute initiating a formal collaborative research agreement with RARU, and now with CASR, in the area of crash injury biomechanics. Also a part of our legacy is that over 40 years ago the Centre''s previous Director, Professor Jack McLean, co-authored the first paper in the world to show that car design played a major role in pedestrian protection, revealing that pedestrians are run under, not over, by the striking car."},{"Helicobacter Pylori Database of Protein Interactomes":"SCR:007120"},{"Helicon Focus":"SCR:014462"},{"HelioScan":"SCR:004494"},{"Helmsley Charitable Trust":"SCR:005111"},{"HemBase":"SCR:002880"},{"Hema-Quebec":"SCR:004700"},{"HemaCare Corp.":"SCR:004803"},{"Heparome":"SCR:008615"},{"Hepatitis B Research Network":"SCR:001531"},{"Hepatitis C Virus Database (HCVdb)":"SCR:005718"},{"Hepatitis Virus B Database":"SCR:007705"},{"Hereditary Disease Foundation":"SCR:006088"},{"Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage":"SCR:006469"},{"HerpNET":"SCR:008374"},{"Herzon Lab":"SCR:008850"},{"Hetero-compound Information Centre- Uppsala":"SCR:007710"},{"HeurAA":"SCR:013212"},{"HiCUP":"SCR:005569"},{"HiPipe":"SCR:001215"},{"HiSpOD":"SCR:014403"},{"HiTC":"SCR:013175"},{"HiTEC":"SCR:011826"},{"Hiclib":"SCR:005535"},{"Hierarchical Attribute Matching Mechanism for Elastic Registration":"SCR:001960"},{"High Performance Computing and Collaboration":"SCR:013167"},{"High Quality SNP Database":"-Arabidopsis Database -Arabidopsis Parallel Analysis of RNA ends (PARE) Database -Arabidopsis Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS) Database -Arabidopsis Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing Plus (MPSS) Database -Rice MPSS Database -Legume SBS Database -Maize SBS Database -Gallus Gallus SBS Database -Magnaporthe MPSS Database -Grape MPSS Database keywords: database, arabidopsis, rice, legume, maize, gallus gallus, magnaporthe, grape"},{"High Resolution Mouse Brain Atlas":"SCR:006063"},{"High Throughput Genomic Sequences Division":"SCR:002150"},{"High-Throughput GoMiner":"SCR:000173"},{"High-dose Ursodiol Therapy of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis":"SCR:006772"},{"High-quality diffusion-weighted imaging of Parkinsons disease":"SCR:014121"},{"HighSSR":"iBioSeminars have viewers in 115 countries and they are being internally promoted in several countries as an educational tool and scientific resource. * Goodwill: Lecturers generously donate their time to prepare these lectures.

The score is calculated according to the following rules: The amino acids of a certain peptide are given a specific value depending on whether they are anchor, auxiliary anchor or preferred residue. Ideal anchors will be given 10 points, unusual anchors 6-8 points, auxiliary anchors 4-6 and preferred residues 1-4 points. Amino acids that are regarded as having a negative effect on the binding ability are given values between -1 and -3.

Determination of plasma drug levels in animals administered the agent under study, and calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters derived from these data. * Determination of bioavailability of the drug after different routes of administration, including oral, intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intramuscular (i.m.), or intraperitoneal (i.p.), as needed. Calculation of the pharmacokinetic parameters from the derived data. * In vitro evaluation of hepatotoxicity in human and animal liver cells. * Preclinical acute toxicity evaluations on lead compounds, evaluating clinical observations, body weights, clinical pathology, histopathology, and plasma drug levels in rodents and non-rodent species. Other toxicology endpoints may be selected if needed. * Subacute and subchronic toxicity evaluations in rodents and large animal species, evaluating clinical observations, body weights, clinical pathology, and histopathology. * Genotoxicity assessments using a battery of appropriate assays. Since these preclinical studies are needed to demonstrate to the FDA that a candidate medication or imaging agent is understood well enough for designing appropriate clinical treatment regimens, most of the work to be conducted to achieve these objectives must be performed and the resulting data analyzed and reported in strict compliance with the FDA''s GLP regulations for nonclinical laboratory studies (21 CFR 58).

In 1981 a census of older persons in the target area was conducted by the investigators, creating an ascertainment list having 99% of the persons identified in the previous year by the US Decennial Census. The baseline survey was conducted between December 1991 and August 1992. Overall, 3,673 persons, or 80% of the target population were interviewed: 65-69 (N = 986), 70-74 (N = 988), 75-79 (N = 815), 80-84 (N = 523), and 85+ (N = 361). The population is virtually entirely Caucasian. Subsequently, personal follow-up surveys were conducted 3, 6, and 10 years after the baseline survey. Telephone surveys were conducted 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 years after the baseline survey. Data collected from respondents included information about demographics, major health conditions, health care utilization, hearing and vision, weight and height, elements of nutrition, sleep problems, depressive and anxiety symptoms, alcohol and tobacco use, cognitive performance and dementia screening, incontinence measures, life satisfaction index, social networks and support, worries, medication use, activities of daily living, dental problems, satisfaction with medical care, life events, brief economic status, automobile driving habits, multiple measures of physical and disability status, and blood pressure. At follow-up #6, there were a series of physical function performance tests, the so-called NIA-MacArthur Battery, and blood was drawn for biochemical tests and potentially other determinations. In addition, some datasets were linked to the EPESE dataset under appropriate restrictions, including Iowa state driving records and clinical diagnoses and medical care utilization from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Alzheimer''s disease (AD) is a central focus both research and education. These primary grants provide the core data acquisition and management structures for numerous other grant-funded and pilot research efforts by investigators at Washington University. Research efforts through the ADRC and HASD focus on identifying causal and risk factor mechanisms in the development of AD and other dementias, biochemical and clinical-behavioral indicators of disease onset and progression, and potential therapeutic and preventative agents. Research participants and family members take part in annual, longitudinal assessments through the ADRC''s clinical office, the Memory and Aging Project (MAP). MAP participants are also invited to take part in various ancillary studies supported by the ADRC, such as clinical drug trials, and provide biological and imaging specimens for basic research projects in affiliated labs across the University. The ACS builds on and focuses work conducted through the ADRC and HASD over the past two decades, with a goal of identifying antecedent biomarkers for the early and preclinical detection of AD. Funded by a multiple-year research grant from the National Institute on Aging, DIAN currently involves ten outstanding research institutions in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. John C. Morris, M.D., Friedman Distinguished Professor of Neurology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is the projects principal investigator. Education Summary The Washington University ADRC is actively involved in providing education about Alzheimers disease and related disorders for students, health professionals, and the lay public. Much of the Centers educational initiatives are coordinated through the Education Core, but all components and faculty of the Center contribute significantly to these efforts. Berg Symposia Held once every two years, the Symposium brings together health professionals, clinical and basic science researchers, and others to learn and discuss a timely topic related to Alzheimer''s disease.

Coordinate toxicology testing programs within the federal government. 2. Strengthen the science base in toxicology. 3. Develop and validate improved testing methods. 4. Provide information about potentially toxic chemicals to health, regulatory, and research agencies, scientific and medical communities, and the public. The need for a program like the NTP arose because of increasing scientific, regulatory, and Congressional concerns about the human health effects of chemical agents in our environment. Many human diseases were thought to be directly or indirectly related to chemical exposures; therefore, it was thought that decreasing or eliminating human exposures to those chemicals would help prevent some human disease and disability. Testing Information The NTP is an interagency program whose mission is to evaluate agents of public health concern by developing and applying the tools of modern toxicology and molecular biology. This involves conducting toxicological evaluations of substances of public health concern, developing and validating improved (sensitive, specific, rapid) testing methods, developing approaches and generating data to strengthen the science base for risk assessment, and communicating with all stakeholders. The NTP plays a critical role in providing needed scientific data, interpretations, and guidance concerning the appropriate uses of data to regulatory agencies and other groups involved with health-related research. Through its interactive relationship with regulatory agencies, the NTP plays an indirect, but important role in shaping public health policy. Study Data Searches The National Toxicology Program makes available data from more than 500 two-year, two species, toxicology and carcinogenesis studies collected by the NTP and its predecessor, the National Cancer Institute''s Carcinogenesis Testing Program, are stored in a database at NIEHS. The NTP database also contains the results collected on approximately 300 toxicity studies from shorter duration tests and from genetic toxicity studies, which includes both in vitro and in vivo tests. In addition, test data from the immunotoxicity, developmental toxicity and reproductive toxicity studies are continually being added to this database. Partnerships Through relationships with regulatory agencies, the NTP has an indirect role in shaping public health policy. Federal and state government agencies rely on the scientific knowledge and its interpretation provided by the NTP to make credible decisions that protect public health and the environment. The NTP also plays a critical role in: 1. Fostering interagency collaborations in research and exposure assessment 2. Providing information to regulatory agencies about alternative methods for toxicity testing, interpretation 3. Exploring new technologies for evaluating how environmental agents cause disease NTP conferences and workshops provide an opportunity for researchers, regulatory, policy makers, and the public to examine issues together, exchange information, and reach agreement on future directions of toxicology and risk assessment.

Article 23: The Commission and Member States should encourage research into the development and validation of alternative techniques which could provide the same level of information as that obtained in experiments using animals, but which involve fewer animals or which entail less painful procedures, and shall take such other steps as they consider appropriate to encourage research in this field. ECVAM has been established in 1992 as a unit of the Environment Institute, part of the Joint Research Centre, and has been transferred to, at that time, newly formed Institute for Health and Consumer Protection in Ispra, Italy in 1998 of which ECVAM is still part of. Duties of ECVAM As defined in the Communication of the European Commission to Council and the European Parliament in October 1991*: 1. To coordinate the validation of alternative test methods at the European Union level. 2. To act as a focal point for the exchange of information on the development of alternative test methods. 3. To set up, maintain and manage a data base on alternative procedures. 4. To promote dialogue between legislators, industries, biomedical scientists, consumer organisations and animal welfare groups, with a view to the development, validation and international recognition of alternative test methods. Moreover, ECVAM should help to expand the JRC''s role in prenormative research. ECVAM thus seeks to promote the scientific and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods which are of importance to the biosciences, through research, new test development and validation, and the establishment of specialised databases, with the aim of contributing to the replacement, reduction and refinement of laboratory animal precedures (in accordance with the 3Rs concept of Russell &amp; Burch***) Due to the political sensitivity of its duties, ECVAM, uniquely at the JRC, has its own Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC) with participation from all Member States, relevant industrial associations, academic toxicology, the animal welfare movement, as well as other Commission services with interest in the alternatives topic area. The Validation Process Validation is the process by which the reliability and relevance of a procedure are established for a specific purpose. In 1995, based upon experience gained during several recent large-scale validation studies, and in consultation with various international experts (including members of ERGATT), ECVAM published recommendations concerning the practical and logistical aspects of validating alternative test methods (ECVAM workshop report 5). Five main stages in the evolution of new test methods were identified: test development; prevalidation; validation (involving a formal interlaboratory study with the testing of coded chemicals); independent assessment; and progression toward regulatory acceptance. ECVAM has implemented a prevalidation scheme, which includes three main phases: protocol refinement, protocol transfer, and protocol performance. The objective of the prevalidation process is to ensure that any method included in a formal validation study adequately fulfills the criteria defined for inclusion in such a study, so that financial and human resources are used more efficiently, and so that there is a greater likelihood that the expectations of those in the scientific, regulatory and animal welfare communities, who seek the replacement of current animal tests by relevant and reliable alternative methods, will be met. In 2004, ECVAM has published the Modular Approach to the ECVAM Principles on Test Validity (select from the top-menu bar the sector Publications followed by ECVAM Selected Articles) that makes the validation process more flexible, by breaking down the various steps in validation into indipendent modules, and defining for each module the information needed for assessing test validity. Collaborations ECVAMs activities are undertaken in collaboration with numerous laboratories and organisations in the EU Member States, and all over the world. ECVAM also works in close collaboration with other Commission services, such as DG Environment, DG Enterprise, DG Research and DG Health and Consumer Protection. Sponsor.

MILANO allows annotation of lists of genes derived from microarray results by user defined terms. The annotation strategy is based on counting the number of literature co-occurrences of each gene on the list with a user defined term. This strategy allows the customization of the annotation procedure and thus overcomes one of the major limitations of the functional annotations usually provided with microarray results. MILANO expands the gene names to include all their informative synonyms while filtering out gene symbols that are likely to be less informative as literature searching terms. It supports searching two literature databases: GeneRIF and Medline (through PubMed), allowing retrieval of both quick and comprehensive results. MILANO''s ability can improve microarray analysis by analyzing a list of 150 genes that were affected by p53 overproduction. This analysis reveals that it enables immediate identification of known p53 target genes on this list and assists in sorting the list into genes known to be involved in p53 related pathways, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. This program performs automatic searches in PubMed or the GeneRIF collection for articles containing co-occurrences of search terms with a list of genes (e.g. from a microarray experiment). The program is used by pasting the list of Gene ID''s or symbols in the Primary Search Term field, and the list of cross-reference search terms in the Secondary Search Term field.

A balance between starting phase quality and data quality must be maintained: You can either have weak (low res) data, and a reasonable starting model, or good (high res) data, in which case even a poor model can produce a very good map. Example: MR solutions with correlation coefficients as low as 0.32 were successfully processed, given 1.7 A data. Bad data and bad model will not work. The reasons are lack of information (GIGO-principle) ultimately causing limited stability of unrestrained ML refinement of the dummy atom model. If you are unsure about the performance in severe borderline cases (for example small, densely packed molecules and bad data and bad model), remove known model parts and observe whether they are recovered, as well as observe whether density ignores questionable model parts. Both cases indicate that bias was removed. The real space correlation plot will also reflect this via distinct and clear deviations (negative spikes) in questionable parts of the model. A relatively flat real space correlation combined with low mean correlation (in the 0.6 range or worse) nearly always indicates failure of the method. This model probably cannot be saved this way, perhaps try RESOLVE - although it probably will also yield to the GIGO principle. Generally, the performance of the program is quite convincing, and we have produced numerous improved quality models for many labs."},{"NIA Scientific Resources":"strict adherence to an important set of abstractions and guiding principles, robust, high-performance numerical methods, support for developing and sharing physics-based models, and careful software engineering. Accessible High Performance Computing We believe that a primary concern of simulation scientists is performance, that is, speed of computation. We seek to build valid, approximate models using classical physics in order to achieve reasonable run times for our computational studies, so that we can hope to learn something interesting before retirement. In the choice of SimTK technologies, we are focused on achieving the best possible performance on hardware that most researchers actually have. In today''s practice, that means commodity multiprocessors and small clusters. The difference in performance between the best methods and the do-it-yourself techniques most people use can be astoundingeasily an order of magnitude or more. The growing set of SimTK Core libraries seeks to provide the best implementation of the best-known methods for widely used computations such as: Linear algebra, numerical integration and Monte Carlo sampling, multibody (internal coordinate) dynamics, molecular force field evaluation, nonlinear root finding and optimization. All SimTK Core software is in the form of C++ APIs, is thread-safe, and quietly exploits multiple CPUs when they are present. The resulting pre-built binaries are available for download and immediate use.

Visually this results in the generation of a grid covering the image. The spot localization algorithm is fully automatic and robust with respect to deviations from perfect spot alignment and contamination. As an input, it requires only the common array design parameters: number of blocks and number of spots in the x and y directions of the array. * The spot quantification module for one-color images performs segmentation of the spots and estimates the averaged spot and local background intensities. The spot quantification module for two-color images estimates the ratio of the measured intensities in the two color channels at each spot reflecting differential gene (cDNA technology) or protein expression or a change in DNA copy number (CGH experiments) between the test and control samples for the corresponding gene. This module includes algorithms based on the linear regression and segmentation of the spots. A special procedure for detection and removal of the aberrant pixels has been developed to make ratio estimates more resistant to array contamination. It ensures more consistent ratio estimates obtained from different algorithms, and allows delivery of a single trustable ratio value. * The quality control module provides a value of spot quality reflecting the level of confidence in the obtained quantitative estimates at each spot. These quality values can be used either directly to flag out some spots with the quality lower than the user-defined threshold, or in the follow-up analysis as a weight controlling the contribution/influence of the obtained ratio estimates. The unique spot quality value for a spot is derived from a set of marginal quality parameters characterizing certain features of the spot. The contribution of each quality parameter in the overall quality is automatically evaluated based on the user visual classification of the spots, or using information available from the replicated spots, located at the same array or over a set of replicated arrays. * The image simulator allows the generation of a broad spectrum of microarray images with different types of contamination (like non-specific hybridization and dust) and noise. Since in simulation experiment the true values of the ratios are known exactly, it allows one to evaluate, to test and to compare different algorithms for microarray image processing objectively."},{"NKI-RS Enhanced Sample":"SCR:010461"},{"NKI-RS Multiband Imaging Test-Retest Pilot Dataset":"SCR:010460"},{"NKI/Rockland Sample":"* Animals: the CGC&#39;s collection of more than 11,273 strains includes one allele of each mapped gene, all available chromosome rearrangements, and selected multiple-mutant stocks for genetic mapping.

A key partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''s Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention branch produced Know Stroke in the Community (KSIC) in 2004. KSIC recruits Stroke Champions in each community who are trained to use NINDS stroke education materials and then charged with bringing campaign messages to their communities. Campaign materials include a stroke education kit with a video, brochures, radio public service announcements (PSAs), and posters. The campaign''s target audiences are those at high risk for stroke - primarily African Americans, Hispanics, and people over the age of 50 - and their family members, caregivers and health care providers. Because stroke attacks the brain, the person experiencing the symptoms often cannot act alone to call 911 and seek medical treatment. Bystanders are integral to acting quickly and getting people who have suffered a stroke to the hospital quickly enough to get time-sensitive treatments. HEALTH PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) offers a variety of educational materials designed for health care professionals involved in treatment of acute stroke. The materials can be ordered in single copies or in quantity, and can be used in medical schools, educational settings, hospitals, clinics, and other health care facilities. The community education kit is a tool for increasing public awareness about stroke. Additional public education materials on stroke are also available for free from NINDS. Know Stroke Toolkit This boxed kit of materials has everything needed for planning and conducting a stroke education event. Included is a facilitator''s guide, with step-by-step training on how to host a stroke awareness event; brochures in Spanish and English; posters; and an award-winning 8 minute videotape featuring interviews with medical experts and stroke patients. Research Spotlight The NINDS conducts stroke research and clinical trials at its laboratories and clinics at the NIH, and through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Partners include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), the National Alliance for Hispanic Health (NAHH), the General Federation of Women''s Clubs (GFWC), the American Stroke Association (ASA), and the National Stroke Association (NSA).

More than 1000 use case tests been defined for these software components, including integration tests. - Integrating different component, gives different flavours of the same simulator, and enhances the user experienced consistency when doing multilevel simulations. - A component based software system avoids vendor-lockin. Its life-cycle is more smooth than that of a monolithic system, because software components can be upgraded one at a time. The Neurospaces project embodies many software components that all have been developed in full isolation. The core of the most important components is finished. The current development focus has shifted from component integration to the support of specific use case with an emphasis on single neuron modeling. This is a list of software components that have been developed or are under construction. Together, these tools give the core for the upcoming GENESIS 3 GUI. - GShell: a simple replacement for the Genesis 2 SLI. - Heccer: a fast compartmental solver, a backend. - Dash: a second compartmental solver faster than Heccer, for simpler models. - Neurospaces Model Container: provides a solver independent internal and external storage format for models. - Discrete event system: consists of a discrete event distributor and queuer. This is used for abstract modeling of an action potential traveling inside an axon as a ''discrete event''. - SSP: a flexible scheduler written in perl, to run simulations with the Neurospaces model container and Heccer. - The Neurospaces Studio: some tools for graphical browsing and command line usage. - The Genesis Script Language Interface: a scripting component that reads Genesis 2 scripts and feeds them to the Neurospaces model container. - The Geometry Library is a general purpose geometry library, with some essential geometrical operators, not commonly found in other geometrical libraries. - Using the Geometry Library, a Reconstruct Interface has been written. This interface supports the conversion of contours exported by the Reconstruct software to the Neurospaces declarative NDF format. - The Neurospaces project browser for browsing projects and inspecting simulation results. - The Installer package contains the Neurospaces installer and developer tools that have emerged from developing Neurospaces software components. - The Configurator package contains configuration utilities for the other tools. It is not needed for the other tools to work properly. Rather, it allows to set up model database and simulation servers in a convenient way. - There is also a Neurospaces blog and a wiki at googlecode for the Neurospaces project, with information for developers."},{"OHSU Bioanalytical Shared Resource/Pharmacokinetics Core Laboratory":"SCR:009963"},{"OHSU Biochemical Genetics Laboratory":"SCR:009964"},{"OHSU Biolibrary":"SCR:004282"},{"OHSU Biomedical Informatics Program":"SCR:009965"},{"OHSU Biomedical Informatics Shared Resource":"SCR:009966"},{"OHSU Brain Institute":"SCR:008932"},{"OHSU Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory":"SCR:009967"},{"OHSU DNA Sequence Analysis Shared Resource":"SCR:009968"},{"OHSU DNA Services Core":"CX3D has been developed with the support of the SECO EU Project (EU grant 216593).

Web-based interfaces have been developed that enable the user to view EPD entries in different formats, to select and extract promoter sequences according to a variety of criteria, and to navigate to related databases exploiting different cross-references. The EPD web site also features yearly updated base frequency matrices for major eukaryotic promoter elements.

In the past 15 years, we have been among the first to discover mutations in genes implicated in the etiology and pathogenesis of early-onset dementia. Specifically we have identified novel mutations in the Amyloid Precursor Protein gene (APP) and Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) that are responsible for hereditary forms of early-onset AD. We have also found several novel mutations responsible for Gerstmann-Str��������ussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease, a hereditary degenerative disease causing ataxia, parkinsonism and dementia secondary to the accumulation of mutated prion protein (PrP).

VAAST builds upon existing amino acid substitution (AAS) and aggregative approaches to variant prioritization, combining elements of both into a single unified likelihood-framework that allows users to identify damaged genes and deleterious variants with greater accuracy, and in an easy-to-use fashion. VAAST can score both coding and non-coding variants, evaluating the cumulative impact of both types of variants simultaneously. VAAST can identify rare variants causing rare genetic diseases, and it can also use both rare and common variants to identify genes responsible for common diseases. VAAST thus has a much greater scope of use than any existing methodology. MAKER 2 (updated 01-16-2012) MAKER is a portable and easily configurable genome annotation pipeline. It''s purpose is to allow smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomeprojects to independently annotate their genomes and to create genome databases. MAKER identifies repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to a genome, produces ab-initio gene predictions and automatically synthesizes these data into gene annotations having evidence-based quality values. MAKER is also easily trainable: outputs of preliminary runs can be used to automatically retrain its gene prediction algorithm, producing higher quality gene-models on seusequent runs. MAKER''s inputs are minimal and its ouputs can be directly loaded into a GMOD database. They can also be viewed in the Apollo genome browser; this feature of MAKER provides an easy means to annotate, view and edit individual contigs and BACs without the overhead of a database. MAKER should prove especially useful for emerging model organism projects with minimal bioinformatics expertise and computer resources. RepeatRunner RepeatRunner is a CGL-based program that integrates RepeatMasker with BLASTX to provide a comprehensive means of identifying repetitive elements. Because RepeatMasker identifies repeats by means of similarity to a nucleotide library of known repeats, it often fails to identify highly divergent repeats and divergent portions of repeats, especially near repeat edges. To remedy this problem, RepeatRunner uses BLASTX to search a database of repeat encoded proteins (reverse transcriptases, gag, env, etc...). Because protein homologies can be detected across larger phylogenetic distances than nucleotide similarities, this BLASTX search allows RepeatRunner to identify divergent protein coding portions of retro-elements and retro-viruses not detected by RepeatMasker. RepeatRunner merges its BLASTX and RepeatMasker results to produce a single, comprehensive XML-based output. It also masks the input sequence appropriately. In practice RepeatRunner has been shown to greatly improve the efficacy of repeat identifcation. RepeatRunner can also be used in conjunction with PILER-DF - a program designed to identify novel repeats - and RepeatMasker to produce a comprehensive system for repeat identification, characterization, and masking in the newly sequenced genomes. CGL CGL is a software library designed to facilitate the use of genome annotations as substrates for computation and experimentation; we call it CGL, an acronym for Comparitive Genomics Library, and pronounce it Seagull. The purpose of CGL is to provide an informatics infrastructure for a laboratory, department, or research institute engaged in the large-scale analysis of genomes and their annotations."},{"PHI-base":"SCR:003331"},{"PHSA Centre for Translational and Applied Genomics":"SCR:012446"},{"PHYCAA+: adaptive physiological noise correction for BOLD fMRI":"SCR:002514"},{"PHYLIP":"SCR:006244"},{"PHYTOPROT":"SCR:013478"},{"PIA":"SCR:013267"},{"PIAGE":"SCR:013124"},{"PICS":"IFLS1 data are available through ICPSR as study number 6706.

SSU-ALIGN is described in part 2 of Eric Nawrocki''s Ph.D. thesis Structural RNA Homology Search and Alignment using Covariance Models. *ERATE:Maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference, including insertions/deletions. Erate is an extension of Joe Felsenstein''s DNAML program which treats insertions and deletions as evolutionary events, rather than ignoring them as missing data (which is what the most widely used phylogenetic inference programs all do). This is the software that accompanied Elena''s paper Probabilistic Phylogenetic Inference with Insertions and Deletions. *CONUS:Software for the exploration of lightweight stochastic context free grammars. This is the code accompanying Robin Dowell''s paper Evaluation of Several Lightweight Stochastic Context-Free Grammars for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction, BMC Bioinformatics 5:71, 2004. It implements several small SCFGs for single-sequence RNA secondary structure prediction. *ATV: A visualization tool for large phylogenetic trees. *RSEARCH: Sequence database searching with RNA structure queries. RSEARCH aligns an RNA query to target sequences, using SCFG algorithms to score both secondary structure and primary sequence alignment simultaneously. It''s slow, but somewhat more capable of finding significant remote RNA structure homologies than sequence alignment methods like BLAST. (By slow, we mean, you really need a substantial computing cluster to do any serious work with it; a typical single search of a metazoan genome may take a few thousand CPU hours). *RECON:Automated identification of repeat sequence families in genome sequences. *tRNAscan-SE: tRNA detection in large-scale genome sequence. tRNAscan-SE detects ~99% of eukaryotic nuclear or prokaryotic tRNA genes, with a false positive rate of less than one per 15 gigabases, and with a search speed of about 30 kb/second. It was implemented for large-scale human genome sequence analysis, but is applicable to other DNAs as well. It applies our COVE software (see below) with a carefully built tRNA covariance model, while getting around COVE''s speed limitations by using two tRNA finding programs from other research groups as fast first-pass scanners (Fichant and Burks'', and an implementation of an algorithm from A. Pavesi''s group). It runs on any UNIX system with Perl and a C compiler installed. *CONSAN: Pairwise structural RNA alignment. This is the code accompanying Robin Dowell''s paper Efficient Pairwise RNA Structure Prediction and Alignment Using Sequence Alignment Constraints , BMC Bioinformatics, 7:400, 2006. It implements a pinned Sankoff algorithm for simultaneous pairwise RNA alignment and consensus structure prediction. *FORESTER: Inference of orthology and paralogy relationships in gene trees. *QRNA: A prototype noncoding RNA genefinder, based on comparative genome sequence analysis. This is the code from Elena Rivas that accompanies the paper Noncoding RNA gene detection using comparative sequence analysis. QRNA uses comparative genome sequence analysis to detect conserved RNA secondary structures, including both ncRNA genes and cis-regulatory RNA structures. *RNABOB: Fast Pattern searching for RNA secondary structures. RNABOB is an implementation of D. Gautheret''s RNAMOT, but with a different underlying algorithm using a nondeterministic finite state machine with node rewriting rules. (Computer scientists would probably cringe in horror. It works, and it''s fast, but is it street legal in a computer science department? Who knows.) An RNABOB motif is a consensus pattern a la PROSITE patterns, but with base-pairing. *PKNOTS: Experimental code demonstrating a dynamic programming algorithm for RNA pseudoknot prediction. This is experimental code from Elena Rivas, demonstrating a dynamic programming algorithm for globally optimal RNA pseudoknot prediction. The algorithm is discussed in the paper A dynamic programming algorithm for RNA structure prediction using pseudoknots. *SQUID: A C library that much of the above software bundles in. C function library for sequence analysis. SQUID is my (Eddy''s) own personal library of C functions and utility programs for sequence analysis. I don''t really suggest that you use it in your programs, as I change it at will. However, it does contains some small utility programs that some people have found useful in scripts that drive large HMMER tasks. *NCRNASCAN: Experimental code for a structural RNA genefinder: it doesn''t actually work well, because it turns out that structural RNAs don''t have much more secondary structure content than random sequence. This is the code from Elena Rivas that goes with the paper Secondary structure alone is generally not statistically significant for the detection of noncoding RNAs by Elena Rivas and Sean Eddy. As the title indicates, the genefinder doesn''t work (though we still think the algorithm is cool), because real RNAs don''t generally have any more secondary structure content than random sequence, contrary to what we expected. The code will only be of interest to people trying to reproduce our negative results, or trying to understand the genome-scanning SCFG alignment algorithm that it implements. *HMMERVIEWER: Robin Dowell''s prototype of a Perl/Tk application for viewing profile HMMs created by HMMER, including the Pfam database. *COVE: Covariance models of RNA secondary structure (old version). COVE is an implementation of stochastic context free grammar methods for RNA sequence/structure analysis. COVE is still experimental and not as well supported as I would like. It is an extremely sensitive tool for database searching for homologous RNAs, if you have an alignment of an RNA family. It requires hefty CPU resources to run properly."},{"PROBEmer":"SCR:010965"},{"PROBMAX":"SCR:009337"},{"PROC QTL":"SCR:009338"},{"PROCOGNATE":"SCR:013348"},{"PROCURE":"SCR:008722"},{"PROCURE Quebec Prostate Cancer Biobank":"SCR:004411"},{"PRODORIC":"SCR:007074"},{"PROFILER":"SCR:009339"},{"PROMIS":"SCR:004718"},{"PROPHECY":"SCR:007206"},{"PROPixx":"SCR:013299"},{"PROSITE":"SCR:003457"},{"PROTOTYPE: Suspected Overlap Among OBO Foundry Candidate Ontologies":"SCR:008834"},{"PROVEAN":"SCR:002182"},{"PROW":"SCR:002434"},{"PRT":"SCR:009340"},{"PReMod":"SCR:003403"},{"PRoNTo":"SCR:006908"},{"PSAR-Align":"SCR:011814"},{"PSAT":"SCR:009341"},{"PSCBS":"SCR:000417"},{"PSCDB - Protein Structural Change DataBase":"SCR:006116"},{"PSEUDO":"SCR:009344"},{"PSEUDOMARKER":"SCR:009345"},{"PSEUDOMARKER.M":"SCR:009346"},{"PSGInfer":"SCR:000243"},{"PSI-MI":"SCR:010710"},{"PSI-MOD":"SCR:004198"},{"PSICQUIC":"SCR:006389"},{"PSICQUIC Registry":"SCR:006392"},{"PSIPRED":"SCR:010246"},{"PSP Association":"SCR:004655"},{"PSTC Nephrotoxicity Biomarkers":"SCR:003709"},{"PSimScan":"online, in booklets and fact sheets, by email, and over the phone.

With caTIES the SPR acts as a locator to tissue resources. * Pioneer research for distributed text information extraction within the context of caBIG. caTIES focuses on IE from SPRs because they represent a high-dividend target for automated analysis. There are millions of SPRs in each major hospital system, and SPRs contain important information for researchers. SPRs act as tissue locators by indicating the presence of tissue blocks, frozen tissue and other resources, and by identifying the relationship of the tissue block to significant landmarks such as tumor margins. At present, nearly all important data within SPRs are embedded within loosely-structured free-text. For these reasons, SPRs were chosen to be coded through caTIES because facilitating access to information contained in SPRs will have a powerful impact on cancer research. Once SPR information has been run through the caTIES Pipeline, the data may be queried and inspected by the researcher. The goal of this search may be to extract and analyze data or to acquire slides of tissue for further study. caTIES provides two query interfaces, a simple query dashboard and an advanced diagram query builder. Both of these interfaces are capable of NCI Metathesaurus, concept-based searching as well as string searching. Additionally, the diagram interface is capable of advanced searching functionalities. An important aspect of the interface is the ability to manage queries and case sets. Users are able to vet query results and save them to case sets which can then be edited at a later time. These can be submitted as tissue orders or used to derive data extracts. Queries can also be saved, and modified at a later time. caTIES provides the following web services by default: MMTx Service, TIES Coder Service"},{"Parallel Stochastic Ion Channel Simulator":"SCR:014159"},{"Parallel-META":"SCR:000121"},{"Parametric Human Project":"SCR:008938"},{"Parametric Time Warping":"SCR:003053"},{"Parasite Databases of Clustered ESTs":"SCR:002262"},{"Parasite Experiment Ontology":"SCR:010403"},{"Parasite genome databases and genome research resources":"SCR:008150"},{"Paris School of Neuroscience PhD Program":"SCR:008355"},{"Parkinson Alliance":"SCR:006961"},{"Parkinson Society Canada":"SCR:002014"},{"Parkinson&#39;s Disease Foundation":"SCR:001832"},{"Parkinson&#39;s Disease Research, Education and Clinical Center":"SCR:008099"},{"Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program":"SCR:002517"},{"Parkinsons Center at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center":"SCR:008096"},{"Parkinsons Disease Discovery Database":"SCR:014160"},{"Parkinsons Disease Mouse Model Resource":"SCR:004142"},{"Parkinsons Disease Online Research":"SCR:001493"},{"Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative":"SCR:006431"},{"Parkinsons UK":"SCR:002022"},{"Parkinsons UK Brain Bank":"SCR:007030"},{"Parkinsons UK Brain Bank Duplicate":"SCR:005244"},{"Parkinsons UK Duplicate":"SCR:004150"},{"ParseCNV":"SCR:000355"},{"Parseq":"SCR:003464"},{"PartiGene ARTHROPODA Database":"SCR:006071"},{"PartiGeneDB":"SCR:007848"},{"ParticleCall":"SCR:001103"},{"Partners HealthCare Biorepository":"Registration of treatment and follow-up of Norwegian cancer patients.

Analysis of a non-redundant test set, consisting of plant protein sequences provides a ~90% accuracy, whereas analysis of a similar set of nonplant protein sequences provides a ~92% accuracy. As input PredSL requires the protein''s sequence in fasta format. The algorithm cosists of 11 steps: # Initially the 100 N-terminal residues of the sequence are coded (see supplementary material-neural network training) and fed to a first layer of 2 neural networks which determine whether a residue belongs or not to a chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) or a mitochondrial transit peptide (mTP). From this step we get 100 scores (one per residue) from each network. # We have set a cutoff where the residues do not belong to a transit peptide any longer, and thus we calculate two approximate cleavage sites from the 100 scores we calculated in step 1.(One from each network) # We take a window of 40 positions around the approximate cleavage site we estimated in step 2, and we use a set of neural networks to predict the cleavage site. Therefore we have one prediction of the cleavage site of the hypothetical cTP and one for the mTP. # We calculate the average of the scores of the hypothetical peptides predicted from each network, and this results to two scores. # We feed the 100 scores from step 1 to two neural networks (one for the cTP and one for the mTP), and we get two more scores. These scores represent the probability that the sequence has an mTP or a cTP. # We use PrediSi to calculate one more score for each sequence. This score represents the probability of a sequence belonging to a secreted protein. # We use a program that uses Markov chains to discriminate between two categories to get 6 more scores for the plant proteins and 3 more for the nonplant. (See supplementary material-Markov chains) # We use HMMER to get two additional scores for each protein. One that shows the existence or not of a cTP and one that shows the existence or not of an mTP. # We feed all the scores we gathered (13 for the plant and 7 for the non-plant proteins) to a neural network that does the final prediction. # Finally, if a sequence is predicted to belong to a chloroplast protein, we use HMMER to determine the existence of a lumenal-transit peptide (lTP) # If the user requires it, PredSL provides the possibility to make a graph for each case. The graphs for the chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences are created using the scores from Step 1 and taking a window around the predicted cleavage site from Step 3. For the secreted proteins, the graphs are created usind the hydrophobicity index (Kytte-Doolittle, 1982) for a window around the predicted cleavage site from PrediSi."},{"Phrap":"SCR:011917"},{"Phred":"SCR:001017"},{"PhyloBayes":"SCR:006402"},{"PhyloFacts":"SCR:007849"},{"PhyloPat":"SCR:007851"},{"PhyloPhlAn":"SCR:013082"},{"PhyloPythia":"SCR:000540"},{"PhyloPythiaS":"* health trajectories, disability and healthy life expectancy; * the determinants of economic position in older age; * the links between economic position, physical health, cognition and mental health; * the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement labour market activity; * household and family structure, social networks and social supports; * patterns, determinants and consequences of social, civic and cultural participation; * predictors of well-being.

NeuroServ is written in Java for platform independence; it also utilizes several open source components * Data sharing: DataQuest is a collaborative forum to facilitate the sharing of neuroimaging data within the neuroscience community. By publishing summaries of existing datasets, DataQuest enables researchers to: # Discover what data is available for collaborative research # Advertise your data to other researchers for potential collaborations # Discover which researchers may have the data you need # Discover which researchers are interested in your data. * Image quality: The approach to assessing the inherent quality of an image is to measure how distorted the image is. Using what are referred to as no-reference or blind metrics, one can measure the degree to which an image is distorted. * Content-based image retrieval: NIRV (NeuroImagery Retrieval & Visualization) is a work environment for advanced querying over imagery. NIRV will have a Java-based front-end for users to issue queries, run processing algorithms, review results, visualize imagery and assess image quality.

BACKGROUND: The high quality of the mouse genome draft sequence and its associated annotations are an invaluable biological resource. Identifying recent duplications in the mouse genome, especially in regions containing genes, may highlight important events in recent murine evolution. In addition, detecting recent sequence duplications can reveal potentially problematic regions of the genome assembly. We use BLAST-based computational heuristics to identify large (>/= 5 kb) and recent (>/= 90% sequence identity) segmental duplications in the mouse genome sequence. Here we present a database of recently duplicated regions of the mouse genome found in the mouse genome sequencing consortium (MGSC) February 2002 and February 2003 assemblies. RESULTS: We determined that 33.6 Mb of 2,695 Mb (1.2%) of sequence from the February 2003 mouse genome sequence assembly is involved in recent segmental duplications, which is less than that observed in the human genome (around 3.5-5%). From this dataset, 8.9 Mb (26%) of the duplication content consisted of &#39;&#39;unmapped&#39;&#39; chromosome sequence. Moreover, we suspect that an additional 18.5 Mb of sequence is involved in duplication artifacts arising from sequence misassignment errors in this genome assembly. By searching for genes that are located within these regions, we identified 675 genes that mapped to duplicated regions of the mouse genome. Sixteen of these genes appear to have been duplicated independently in the human genome. From our dataset we further characterized a 42 kb recent segmental duplication of Mater, a maternal-effect gene essential for embryogenesis in mice. CONCLUSION: Our results provide an initial analysis of the recently duplicated sequence and gene content of the mouse genome. Many of these duplicated loci, as well as regions identified to be involved in potential sequence misassignment errors, will require further mapping and sequencing to achieve accuracy. A Genome Browser database was set up to display the identified duplication content presented in this work. This data will also be relevant to the growing number of investigators who use the draft genome sequence for experimental design and analysis. The segmental duplication data and summary statistics are available for download and can also be visualized in a genome browser in the GBrowse section. Selected annotation tracks (except the segmental duplication track) have also been obtained from UCSC and loaded into the genome browser. Detailed information (e.g. overlapping genes, overlapping clones, detailed alignment) can be obtained by clicking on a duplication cluster in GBrowse. Both keyword search and BLAT search are available. Analyses based on previous genome assemblies can be found in the Previous Analyses section. Recent Developments The Non-Human Genome Segmental Duplication Database is continually updated including the archived copies of the analysis of all previous genome assemblies and will include all new species as they become available.

The CSR focuses: on software and finding the format conversion paths described by a number of software packages and unique input and output formats. The formats themselves are represented by extensions. While not always unique, extensions are often the only accessible information when the 3rd party software is installed (often listed under the File/Open menu in most packages). The CSR also contains information about the software, operating system, software interface and scripts to execute the software. The scripts are important for the automating conversions with the 3rd party software and can be implemented using AutoHotkey scripts (Windows), AppleScript (Mac) or one of a variety of scripting languages for Unix. The information loss due to file format conversions is measured externally by different techniques within the NCSA object-to-object comparison framework called Versus. The comparison is relevant to the software domain, for example for 3D applications surface area or spin images are used and the loss (0-100 range with 100 representing no loss) for a particular software-conversion pair is stored in the database. The information loss also represents edge weights to Input/Output (I/O) Graph, a simple workflow used for finding the shortest conversion path. The CSR is written as a web service. It consists of three main components: Query, Add, Edit. In the Query mode users can a) view list of all software packages with their conversion options, b) select subsets of software in the I/O-Graph, c) search the database by conversions, software, extensions, MIME and PUID. The I/O-Graph contains all information about installed applications and the conversions they allow. The JAVA applet front end is part of the CSR web visualization interface. Section Add allows users to add new software packages with their conversion capabilities and upload the software scripts to automate them. The last section, Edit is designed for adding detailed information about the software, extensions and for uploading the test files. CSR requires users to login for adding and editing.

To do this, the LAMHDI database is prepared from a variety of sources. The LAMHDI team takes publicly available data from OMIM, NCBI''s Entrez Gene database, Homologene, and WikiPathways, and builds a mathematical graph (think of it as a map or a web) that links these data together. OMIM is used to link human diseases with specific human genes, and Entrez provides universal identifiers for each of those genes. Human genes are linked to their counterpart genes in other species with Homologene, and those genes are linked to other genes tentatively or authoritatively using the data in WikiPathways. This preparatory work gives LAMHDI a web of human diseases linked to specific human genes, orthologous human genes, homologous genes in other species, and both human and non-human genes involved in specific metabolic pathways associated with those diseases. LAMHDI includes model data that partners provide directly from their data structures. For instance, MGI provides information about mouse models, including a disease for each model, as well as some genetic information (the ID of the model, in fact, identifies one or more genes). ZFIN provides genetic information for each zebrafish model, but no diseases, so zebrafish models are integrated by using the genes as the glue. For instance, a zebrafish model built to feature the zebrafish PKD2 gene would plug into the larger disease-gene map at the node representing the zebrafish PKD2 gene, which is connected to the node representing the human PKD2 gene, which in turn is connected to the node representing the human disease known as polycystic kidney disease. (Some of the partner data LAMHDI receives can even extend the base map. MGI provides a disease for every model, and in some cases this allows the creation of a disease-to-gene relationship in the LAMHDI database that might not already be documented in the OMIM dataset.) With curatorial and model information in hand, LAMHDI runs a lengthy automated process that exhaustively searches for every possible path between each model and each disease in the data, up to a set number of hops, producing for each disease-to-model pair a set of links from the disease to the model. The algorithm avoids circular paths and paths that include more than one disease anywhere in the middle of the path. At the end of this phase, LAMHDI has a comprehensive set of paths representing all the disease-to-model relationships in the data, varying in length from one hop to many hops. Each disease-to-model path is essentially a string of nodes in the data, where each node represents a disease, a gene, a linkage between genes (an orthologue, a homologue, or a pathway connection, referred to as a gene cluster or association), or a model. Each node has a human-friendly label, a set of terms and keywords, and - in most cases - a URL linking the node to the data source where it originated. When a researcher submits a search on the LAMHDI website, LAMHDI searches for the user''s search terms in its precomputed list of all known disease-to-model paths. It looks for the terms not only in the disease and model nodes, but also in every node along each path. The complete set of hits may include multiple paths between any given disease-to-model pair of endpoints. Each of these disease-to-model pair sets is ordered by the number of hops it involves, and the one involving the fewest hops is chosen to represent its respective disease-to-model pair in the search results presented to the user. Results are sorted by scores that represent their matches. The number of hops is one barometer of the strength of the evidence linking the model and the disease; fewer hops indicates the relationship is stronger, more hops indicates it may be weaker. This indicator works best for comparing models from a single partner dataset: MGI explicitly identifies a disease for each mouse model, so there can be disease-to-model hits for mice that involve just one hop. Because ZFIN does not explicitly identify a disease for each model, no zebrafish model will involve fewer than four hops to the nearest disease, from the zebrafish model to a zebrafish gene to a gene cluster to a human gene to a human disease."},{"PyPedal":"SCR:012104"},{"PySurfer":"SCR:002524"},{"PyroBayes":"SCR:003757"},{"PyroHMMsnp":"SCR:000357"},{"PyroHMMvar":"SCR:002073"},{"Pyrocleaner":"SCR:000584"},{"Pythagorean Displacement and Motion Regressors":"SCR:002525"},{"Pythia":"SCR:004952"},{"Python Programming Language":"SCR:008394"},{"Pythonxy":"SCR:006903"},{"Q Capture software":"SCR:014432"},{"Q-Value Software":"i) diffusion parameter data that is ready for statistical analysis; ii) brain anatomical networks constructed by using diffusion tractography.

The face-to-face interviews and biomeasure collection took place in respondents' ''' homes. NSHAP uses a national area probability sample of community residing adults born between 1920 and 1947 (aged 57 to 85 at the time of the Wave 1 interview), which includes an oversampling of African-Americans and Hispanics. The NSHAP sample is built on the foundation of the national household screening carried out by the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in 2004. Through a collaborative agreement, HRS identified households for the NSHAP eligible population. A sample of 4,400 people was selected from the screened households. NSHAP made one selection per household. Ninety-two percent of the persons selected for the NSHAP interview were eligible. For Wave 2 in 2010 and 2011, NSHAP returned to Wave 1 Respondents and eligible non-interviewed respondents from Wave 1 (Wave 1 Non-Interviewed Respondents). NSHAP also extended the Wave 2 sample to include the cohabiting spouses and romantic partners of Wave 1 Respondents and Wave 1 Non-Interviewed Respondents. Partners were considered to be eligible to participate in NSHAP if they resided in the household with the Wave 1 Respondent/Wave 1 Non-Interviewed Respondent at the time of the Wave 2 interview and were at least 18 years of age. Wave I biomeasures: height; weight; waist circumference; blood pressure; smell; taste; vision; touch; respondent-administered vaginal swabs; oral mucosal transudate (OMT) for HIV-1 antibody screening; saliva; ����??get up and go����??; and blood spots. Technological advances in biomeasure collection methods have decreased respondent burden and increased ease of collection, storage, and yield of various biomeasures for the second wave of NSHAP. Wave II biomeasures: anthropometrics, including height, hip and waist circumference, and weight; cardiovascular function, including blood pressure, heart rate variability, and pulse; 2 of the 3 components of the short physical performance battery (SPPB) including chair stands and a timed walk; sensory function including smell; and actigraphy. In addition, we collect dried blood spots, microtainer blood, passive drool and salivettes, urine, and respondent-administered vaginal swabs, each of which are analyzed using multiple assays for a variety of measures and rationales. Furthermore, we assess respondents����?? cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Data Availability: NSHAP data made available to the public does not contain any identifiable respondent information and uses code numbers instead of names for all data. De-identified data from the 2005 and 2006 interviews are available to researchers through the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging, located within Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). Data from the Wave 2 interviews in 2010 and 2011 will be available in the summer of 2012. * Dates of Study: 2005-2006, 2010-2011 * Study Features: Biospecimens, Anthropometric Measures * Sample Size: ** Wave 1: 3,005 ** Wave 2: 3,377 Links: * ICPSR: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/20541"},{"RegRNA":"ounded in 1931 as the Harvey Cushing Society, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) is a scientific and educational association with over 7,400 members worldwide.

In the Beginning products_profile.jpg SERVA was founded 1953 in Heidelberg a major center of the life sciences by the chemist Dr. Nikolaus Grubhofer. His idea was to supply fine biochemical reagents to research laboratories in academia and industry, to serve science (SERVA = lat. servare). 1961 the first catalog listed approx. 450 products. In the 1970''s, SERVA was well known for its comprehensive program of Fine Biochemicals, supplying laboratories all over the world with top quality reagents. Evolving technologies for separation of biomolecules (bioseparation) initiated a new phase at SERVA: proprietary product development. A range of reagents for electrophoresis and chromatography was brought to the market during the 1970''s and 1980''s. Precast gels for Isoelectric Focusing, carrier ampholytes and other specialities are still produced in-house. Going Multinational In 1986, SERVA changed ownership to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma Corporation, contributing to building a bio-business. As a distribution partner for various key product lines from the USA, SERVA successfully met the instantaneous demand of the vast growing market of life science research. 1998 Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma finally decided to sell SERVA to the US-based Novex Corporation, a major supplier in electrophoresis. SERVA, now officially SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH, continued unaffected focusing on fine biochemicals, electrophoresis and life sciences. 1999 Novex Corp. was acquired by Invitrogen Corp., USA. SERVA remained part of the Invitrogen group until 2002. Bridge to The Future After a management-buy-out in July 2002, SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH is now independent again, owned completely by German shareholders. The organisation continues, with headquarters in Heidelberg, supplying top quality products through its global distribution network. We build a bridge from the present to the future: Developing existing technology at SERVA further to become a leading player in the market of life sciences, specializing in certain areas. Our mission is to provide innovative products originating from our own know-how and through collaborations and strategic alliances. An important milestone in our strategy was reached in 2002. SERVA Electrophoresis GmbH and Nordmark-Arzneimittel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany, formed a partnership for manufacture, development and distribution of collagenase. Nordmark is the world''s largest producer of collagenase, which is used in tissue culture to isolate cells, cell aggregates and organs. SERVA markets Nordmark''s collagenase for biological applications worldwide. SERVA''s commitment is to meet the changing needs of scientists while sustaining consistently high product quality and customer service.

The AAindex1 section of the Amino Acid Index Database is a collection of published indices together with the result of cluster analysis using the correlation coefficient as the distance between two indices. This section currently contains 544 indices. Another important feature of amino acids that can be represented numerically is the similarity between amino acids. Thus, a similarity matrix, also called a mutation matrix, is a set of 210 numerical values, 20 diagonal and 20x19/2 off-diagonal elements, used for sequence alignments and similarity searches. The AAindex2 section of the Amino Acid Index Database is a collection of published amino acid mutation matrices together with the result of cluster analysis.

Accepted for publication in Biostatistics. [Abstract, PDF, PS, Complementary Color Figures-PDF, Software] What do I need? You will need the appropriate CDF and CEL files for your dataset. For Exon and WT Gene arrays, the PGF and CLF should be used instead of the CDF file to build a CDFRME file. The process for doing this is explained in the user manual. Some pre-built CDFRME files are also available. CDFRME files HuEx_CDFRME.zip (95.9MB) HuGene_CDFRME.zip (5.5MB) MoEx_CDFRME.zip (79.6MB) MoGene_CDFRME.zip (6.3MB) RaEx_CDFRME.zip (48.4MB) RaGene_CDFRME.zip (5.7MB) Can I use affy/BioConductor instead? Of course. Hypothetically you will get the same results from both places, provided you have consistent settings in affy/BioConductor and RMAExpress. Some people prefer the power and flexibility of R and others like the point and click simplicity of a GUI. RMAExpress caters to the second option. Since RMAExpress outputs the computed expression values to a text file, you may of course load the expression measures into R and use features of Bioconductor for the analysis of your gene expression values. You can of course open the results file in any other application that supports importing plain text files. Will I get the same results as I would using affy/Bioconductor? Yes. The results from RMAExpress should be consistent. What are the machine requirements? A good rule of thumb is the more RAM you have the better. I would recommend at least 1GB, though 512MB will work in most situations. At this point the program has been tested using Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Linux. Most recently I have had a report of over 10,000 arrays processed in a single session. Can I do any quality assessment? Yes, store the residuals when you compute the expression values. Then you may examine chip pseudo-images of the residuals. Note that high positive residuals are colored increasingly read and low negative residuals are colored increasingly blue. To better interpret these images and gain a better feel for what is typical you may visit the PLM Image Gallery where images for a number of different datasets are shown. Access to the NUSE and RLE quality assessment metrics is also provided. How do I download and install it? Click here for the current release Windows version. Use the installer to install the program. The current release version number is 1.0 (released June 29, 2008). A pre-built linux version is not currently available, but you may build it using the source code. You can download pre-release versions from the following table (the release versions will be more stable, the development versions may have features that are incomplete or will be removed or altered before the next release was supported by the PGA U01 HL66583."},{"SeqPipe":"SCR:011862"},{"SeqPrep":"SCR:013004"},{"SeqSaw":"SCR:009185"},{"SeqSite":"SCR:013243"},{"SeqTRACS":"SCR:013294"},{"SeqTrace":"SCR:005580"},{"SeqWare":"SCR:005289"},{"SeqtrimNEXT":"SCR:011845"},{"Sequedex":"SCR:001233"},{"Sequence Read Format":"SCR:000132"},{"Sequence Search and Alignment by Hashing Algorithm":"SCR:000544"},{"Sequence Tag Alignment and Consensus Knowledgebase Database":"SCR:002156"},{"Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression Study":"the Biomanufacturing Program (BioMAN), the Consortium on Adventitious Agents in Biomanufacturing (CAACB), and New Drug Development Paradigms (NEWDIGS).

This section contains samples from patients affected by Rett syndrome, a neurodegenerative disease affecting almost exclusively girls with an estimated frequency of 1:10000-15000 live born. By accessing the section users can see a list of all patients available with their phenotype, the specific MECP2 or CDKL5 mutation if known and the kind of biological samples available for each patient. The availability of this large panel of patients is potentially important for the clarification of the molecular bases of Rett syndrome. In fact, a 20-30 of Rett cases do not have MECP2 or CDKL5 mutations. These patients might bear intronic/promoter MECP2 or CDKL5 mutations or they might have alterations in one or more genes different from MECP2 or CDKL5, as suggested by the identification of various chromosomal rearrangements. To confirm a causative role of these rearrangements, and to identify the relevant gene/s, it is important to collect a great number of patients in which to search for overlapping rearrangements or point mutations in candidate genes. # X-Linked Mental Retardation. This section contains samples collected by the centers belonging to the Italian network on X-linked mental retardation, which includes the laboratory of bank curators (for specific information on the network goals and organization, go to the section page). Mental retardation (MR) is the most frequent cause of serious handicap in humans with an estimated prevalence of 0,3-0,5 for moderate to severe MR (IQ<50) which increases to 1-1,5 when mild MR (IQ 50-70) is included. It is calculated that about 20-25 of mentally retarded males have a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome (X-linked mental retardation). X-linked mental retardation is a genetically heterogeneous condition. This is particularly true for the non-syndromic form (MRX), where MR is the only consistent clinical finding and no distinctive features between patients exist. In this situation the only possibility to group patients from different families is represented by linkage analysis, which needs the availability of large families. However, families linked to the same region demonstrate different causative genes. In these conditions, the number of patients available for analysis is a discriminating factor since a large number of patients need to be tested in order to fully confirm or exclude the involvement of a gene in MRX. # Other. This section of the bank contains biological materials and clinical data of patients with other genetic disorders (different from Rett and X-linked mental retardation). Part of this section is dedicated to Alport syndrome.

In each year since 1984, the GSOEP has attempted to re-interview original sample members unless they leave the country. A major expansion of the GSOEP was necessitated by German reunification. In June 1990, the GSOEP fielded a first wave of the eastern states of Germany. This sub-sample includes individuals in private households where the head of household was a citizen of the German Democratic Republic. The first wave contains 2,179 households. In 1994 and 1995, the GSOEP added a sample of immigrants to the western states of Germany from 522 households who arrived after 1984, which in 2006 included 360 households and 684 respondents. In 1998 a new refreshment sample of 1,067 households was selected from the population of private households. In 2000 a sample was drawn using essentially similar selection rules as the original German sub-sample and the 1998 refreshment sample with some modifications. The 2000 sample includes 6,052 households covering 10,890 individuals. Finally, in 2002, an overrepresentation of high-income households was added with 2,671 respondents from 1,224 households, of which 1,801 individuals (689 households) were still included in the year 2006. Data Availability: The data are available to researchers in Germany and abroad in SPSS, SAS, TDA, STATA, and ASCII format for immediate use. Extensive documentation in English and German is available online. The SOEP data are available in German and English, alone or in combination with data from other international panel surveys (e.g., the Cross-National Equivalent Files which contain panel data from Canada, Germany, and the United States).

Develop methodologies, especially in terms of quality control, normalisation, quantification and data analysis, that will be broadly applicable to the design and implementation of genomics experiments in metazoans. As a complex eukaryote with a compact genome, the Drosophila model is ideally suited to such a role. To expand the scope of the genomics resources to enable the community to encompass the use of whole genome arrays for expression profiling, transcription factor binding studies and chromatin structure studies. To develop a more cohesive interaction with members of the community who require access to genomics tools. We wish offer a flexible and interactive service for UK researchers, accommodating those who need access to reagents to perform their own genomics studies or hosting researchers within the facility for more complex studies. Utilise Drosophila as a model for establishing an effective metazoan systems biology platform. To form multidisciplinary collaborations aimed at developing new genomics techniques and informatics methods.

Biobank Graz comprises both population-based and disease-focused collections of biological materials. It currently contains approx. 3.8 mio samples from approx. 1.2 mio patients representing a nonselected patient group characteristic of central Europe. Because the Institute of Pathology was, until 2003, the exclusive pathology service provider for major parts of the province of Styria, including its capital Graz (population approx. 1.2 mio people), samples from all human diseases, treated by surgery or diagnosed by biopsy, are included in the collection at their natural frequency of occurrence and thus represent cancers and non-cancerous diseases from all organs, and from all age groups. The scientific value of the existing tissue collection is, thus, not only determined by its size and technical homogeneity (all samples have been processed in a single institute under constant conditions for more than 20 years), but also by its population-based character. These features provide ideal opportunities for epidemiological studies and allow the validation of biomarkers for the identification of specific diseases and determination of their response to treatment. Prospectively collected tissues, blood samples and clinical data comprise, on the one hand, randomly selected samples from all diseases and patient groups to provide sufficient numbers of samples for the evaluation of the disease-specificity of any gene or biomarker. On the other hand, Biobank Graz adopts a disease-focused approach for selected diseases (such as breast, colon and liver cancers as well as some metabolic diseases) through the collection of a range of different human biological samples of highest quality and detailed clinical follow-up data.

Some streams are high-predation environments, others low-predation. Different predation environments are often right next to one another, separated by a waterfall (which neither guppies nor predators can cross). Guppies from high-predation environments experience much higher mortality rates than do guppies in low-predation environments. High mortality is associated with the following characteristics, all of which have a genetic basis: * Earlier maturity * Greater investment of resources in reproduction * More and smaller offspring. We have found that mortality rates can be manipulated by: * Transplanting guppies from high-predation localities into sites from which they and their predators had previously been excluded by natural waterfalls, thus lowering mortality rates; * Introducing predators into low-predation sites, thus increasing mortality rates. Such experiments have shown that species evolve as predicted by theory.

The goal Project is to find most genetic variants that have frequencies of at least 1% in the populations studied. Sequencing is still too expensive to deeply sequence the many samples being studied for this project. However, any particular region of the genome generally contains a limited number of haplotypes. Data can be combined across many samples to allow efficient detection of most of the variants in a region. The Project currently plans to sequence each sample to about 4X coverage; at this depth sequencing cannot provide the complete genotype of each sample, but should allow the detection of most variants with frequencies as low as 1%. Combining the data from 2500 samples should allow highly accurate estimation (imputation) of the variants and genotypes for each sample that were not seen directly by the light sequencing.

It comes with a training program that estimates the parameters given a training set of known genes. It also comes with an optimization script that tries to find values for the meta parameters, like splice window sizes, that optimize the prediction accuracy. :- AUGUSTUS can be used ab initio and has a flexible mechanism for incorporating extrinsic information, e.g. from EST alignments and protein alignments. :- AUGUSTUS can predict alternative splicing and alternative transcripts. :- AUGUSTUS can predict the 5''UTR and 3''UTR including introns. This is in particular helpful when using EST alignments as the majority of ESTs aligns in the untranslated regions. This feature is currently only trained for human, the red algae Galdieria sulphuraria, Caenorhabditis elegans, Toxoplasma gondii, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, pea aphid and Culex pipens (3''UTR only). :- AUGUSTUS can report a large number of alternative genes, including probabilities for the transcripts and each exon and intron.

The Pleiades Promoter Project will use the latest scientific techniques to address all three. One of the outcomes of the Project will be to use bioinformatics to characterize genes expressed in the mouse brain and identify which cells and regions they are expressed in and which segments of DNA (the promoters) turn the genes on and off. This data will provide an invaluable resource to scientist and clinical researchers. The end goal of this project is to generate 160 fully characterized, human DNA promoters of less than 4 kb (MiniPromoters) to drive gene expression in defined brain regions of therapeutic interest for diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Multiple Sclerosis, Spinocerebellar Ataxia, Depression, Autism, and Cancer. This Project is the daughter of an ongoing Genome Canada Project, the Atlas of Gene Expression in Mouse Development, within which the mouse brain gene expression data have already been gathered. The project also builds on three additional Genome Canada investments: the Bioinformatics of Mammalian Gene Expression developed software applicable to this work; the Genome BC Sequencing and Mapping Platform will provide sequencing; and the Genome BC Bioinformatics Platform will support the entire undertaking. One of the strengths of The Pleiades Promoter Project is the way it brings together highly specialized Canadian resources. Bioinformatics, high throughput genomics, neuroimaging and transgenic mouse technology are all important activities on their own but together, they have the power to create success for Canada. The process of the Project will generate highly valuable resources that will gain high recognition for Canadian Scientists. To ensure the success of these resources (bioinformatics software, promoters, mouse embryonic stem cell lines, and transgenic mice), the team has collaborated with International BioPharma Solutions Ltd., a management and communications consulting company specializing in product development and commercialization advice. Finally, the project will explore the challenging interface between science and journalism with a focus on genomics and gene therapy. A team lead by Dr. Stephen Ward of the UBC School of Journalism will develop new ways to better communicate controversial science to the public.

The Ponce School of Medicine (PSM) RCMI AIDS Research Infrastructure Program (ARIP) proposes to further upgrade its core laboratory units in order to best meet the needs of current and prospective ARIP faculty members. It also proposes to facilitate the institution of career development programs specifically designed to meet the identified requirements of the ARIP faculty members; the current mentoring and partnership program will be strengthened to support their careers. The proposed ARIP Phase V activities will revolve around three specific aims. Specific Aim #1: To further improve and expand the research capabilities of the AIDS research core laboratories in viral genetics, immunology, and drugs of abuse. ARIP cores will be made accessible to the AIDS/HIV investigators from other institutions and countries in order to facilitate the development of high caliber collaborative research that will share the same technologies. The advanced technologies and instrumentation offered by ARIP will enable investigators to study the characteristics of the AIDS/HIV infection in the Caribbean region. Sophisticated instruments and equipment will be made available in real time to investigators from other institutions (via an Internet-2 connection) in an ongoing effort to foster collaboration. By accessing the institution website (www.psm.edu), interested investigators can take part in online training sessions as well as reserve instruments. Specific Aim #2: To implement a career development program (tailor-made for individual ARIP faculty members) that will include research & career mentoring, research consultation, and partnership development. A concerted effort will be made to develop a viable institutional faculty retention plan, which will include faculty incentives through research enterprise activities; in the past, lack of effective faculty development and retention programs has caused the loss of key members. Critical self-analyses were performed to identify the needs of current faculty members so that specific plans might be designed around the requirements of each individual. Specific Aim #3: To implement additional AIDS/HIV-related research programs at PSM as well as at the island?s other three RCMI-sponsored institutions. PSM currently has eight faculty members with actively funded AIDS-related independent research projects (representing the greatest number among the PR RCMI institutions). ARIP members have been active in pursuing the possibility of developing CFAR and CTSA proposals via the program?s ongoing partnership with the consortium of U-FL, USF, FCU, and FSU."},{"matlab-bgl":"SCR:006981"},{"metaArray":"SCR:001353"},{"metaMA":"SCR:000408"},{"metaRNASeq":"SCR:002174"},{"metaSeq":"SCR:000056"},{"metaTIGER":"SCR:007781"},{"metabnorm":"SCR:001266"},{"metagen":"SCR:003443"},{"metahdep":"SCR:001225"},{"metaphor":"SCR:003450"},{"methPrimerDB":"SCR:012017"},{"methVisual":"SCR:006705"},{"methyAnalysis":"SCR:001290"},{"methylKit":"SCR:005177"},{"methylMnM":"SCR:001289"},{"miR-PREFeR":"SCR:003353"},{"miR2Disease":"SCR:007792"},{"miRBase":"* Developing and maintaining international standards for describing resources * Supporting a worldwide community of users and developers * Promoting widespread use of Dublin Core solutions The major characteristics of DCMI as an organization are (the three Is): * Independent: DCMI is not controlled by specific commercial or other interests and is not biased towards specific domains nor does it mandate specific technical solutions * International: DCMI encourages participation from organizations anywhere in the world, respecting linguistic and cultural differences * Influenceable: DCMI is an open organization aiming at building consensus among the participating organizations; there are no prerequisites for participation The development and maintenance of a core set of metadata terms (the DCMI Metadata Terms) continues to be one of the main activities of DCMI.

A few additional issues make the task even more complicated: (1) symbols may have aliases; and (2) one sequence may have a couple of relatives that we want to take into account too, which include redundant (e.g. protein and gene sequences) and close homologs. Here the issues are addressed by the development of the software MedBlast, which can retrieve the related articles of the given sequence automatically. MedBlast uses BLAST to extend homology relationships, precompiled species-specific thesauruses, a useful semantics technique in natural language processing (NLP), to extend alias relationship, and EUtilities toolset to search and retrieve corresponding articles of each sequence from PubMed. MedBlast take a sequence in FASTA format as input. The program first uses BLAST to search the GenBank nucleic acid and protein non-redundant (nr) databases, to extend to those homologous and corresponding nucleic acid and protein sequences. Users can input the BLAST results directly, but it is recommended to input the result of both protein and nucleic acid nr databases. The hits with low e-values are chosen as the relatives because the low similarity hits often do not contain specific information.

The ABC proteins are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes in Archaea, Bacteria and Eucaryota where they are encoded by large families of paralogous genes. The majority of ABC domains energize the transport of compounds across membranes. In bacteria, ABC transporters are involved in the uptake of a wide variety of molecules, as well as in mechanisms of virulence and antibiotic resistance. In eukaryotes, most of them are involved in drug resistance and in human cell, many are associated with diseases. Sequence analysis reveals that members of the ABC superfamily can be organized into sub-families, and suggests that they have diverged from common ancestral forms. A typical ABC transporter system is composed of an assembly of protein domains that serve different functions: i) two Nucleotide Binding Domains (NBD) that energize transport via ATP hydrolysis, ii) two Membrane Spanning Domains (MSD) that act as a membrane channel for the substrate, and iii) for the importer, a Solute Binding Protein (SBP) that confers substrates specificity on the transporter. The different partners of an ABC system are generally encoded by neighboring genes. The database includes information on: * ABC transporters * Protein partners * Protein domains (NBD, MSD and SBP) * Classification of ABC transporters and their protein partners * Taxonomy of the species Each model Protein includes a link to the Peptide sequence, general information extracted from EMBL files, and specific tags to store results of predictions. The results of the annotation procedure are reachable through the class Prediction. The origin of the proteins is modeled as a path through the classes Chromosome, Strain, Species, and Taxon.

It must be clearly stated what the intended referent of each URI is supposed to be, i.e. that the URI denotes some particular record from some particular database. 2. Information about the URI and its referent, including such a statement, must be made available, and in order to leverage existing protocol stacks, it must be obtainable via HTTP. (We''ll call such information URI documentation.) 3. URI documentation must be provided in RDF. 4. Provision of URI documentation must be an ongoing concern. The ability to provide it may have to outlive the original database or the database''s creator. 5. The provider of the URI documentation must be responsive to community needs, such as the need to have mistakes fixed in a timely manner. 6. URI documentation must be open so that it can be replicated and reused. Control of shared URIs should be in the hands of those who depend on them. This is the best way to ensure that the URIs serve the community in the ways listed above. Overall design The idea is to manage a server, or a set of servers, that can deliver appropriate RDF documents for the shared URIs. An HTTP GET of a URI would retrieve not the database record itself, but rather one of these RDF documents (perhaps via a 303 redirect). The RDF document will include the following: 1. Documentation specifying what the URI denotes (URI documentation), including an rdf:type, the database that the record comes from, and the record''s identifier or key within that database. 2. Links to the various encodings of the record provided by the data provider, e.g. XML, ASN, HTML for the NCBI databases and so on. Each of these encodings would in turn have its own URI naming that particular encoding of the record, the main URI being the name of the record without commitment as to encoding. 3. Links as appropriate to corresponding resources belonging to semantic web projects participating in the common naming scheme, e.g. http://bio2rdf.org/pmid:15456405. 4. Links as appropriate to related external resources that build on the database record. For example, the RDF for PubMed record 15456405 could link out to the iHOP page for the article described by the PubMed record. 5. Other information related to the record that might be of use to a human reader or automated agent. External links can be represented rigorously in RDF, allowing programs that access the RDF to proceed deterministically not only to the various encodings but also to any of the various related resources. This might be accomplished by having a distinct property for each participating project, or in some other way. We do not generally expect the RDF to include any of the content of the database record, although there is no particular reason to rule this out (except in cases where license terms preclude it). science, commons, biological, bioinformatic, naming"},{"total impact.org":"SCR:005952"},{"tranSMART":"SCR:005586"},{"tree editor":"SCR:004533"},{"tweeDEseq":"SCR:003038"},{"ull,":"SCR:007646"},{"unifiedWMWqPCR":"SCR:001706"},{"vIST/e":"SCR:001627"},{"vcf2MSAT":"SCR:013034"},{"vcflib":"SCR:001231"},{"vegan":"SCR:011950"},{"vipR":"SCR:010685"},{"virtualArray":"SCR:001361"},{"vis: SPM Visualized Statistics toolbox":"SCR:002619"},{"vmtk in 3DSlicer":"SCR:002579"},{"vsn":"SCR:001459"},{"vuTools":"SCR:001704"},{"wANNOVAR":"SCR:000565"},{"wFleaBase":"SCR:006018"},{"wapRNA":"SCR:013292"},{"wateRmelon":"SCR:001296"},{"waveTM":"SCR:006199"},{"waveTiling":"SCR:001322"},{"waviCGH":"SCR:006662"},{"webhealth.com":"SCR:010724"},{"wikiCancer":"SCR:001824"},{"www.brainmapping.org":"SCR:001987"},{"xFITOM":"SCR:014445"},{"xMSanalyzer":"SCR:012144"},{"xjView: A Viewing Program For SPM":"SCR:008642"},{"yMGV - Yeast microarray global viewer":"SCR:007137"},{"yaqcaffy":"SCR:001295"},{"zfishbook":"SCR:006896"}]}
